The results are evaluated by using the SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy. Data analysis suggested novice programmers with role-based teaching tended to experience better performances, including the SOLO level of program comprehension, program debugging scores, program explaining scores, except for programming language knowledge scores, compared with the classical case-based teaching method. Considering the SOLO category of program comprehension and performances, evidence that the roles of variables can provide scaffolding to understand case programs through combining its program structure with its related problem domain is discussed, and the SOLO categories for relational reasoning are proposed. Meanwhile, the roles of variables can assist the novice in learning programming language knowledge. These results indicate that combing case-based teaching with the role of variables is an effective way to improve novice program comprehension.;[Shi, Nianfeng] Luoyang Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Luoyang 471000, Peoples R China;Luoyang Institute of Science & Technology;Shi, NF (corresponding author), Luoyang Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Luoyang 471000, Peoples R China.;shinf@lit.edu.cn;shi, Nianfeng/J-2745-2019;shi, Nianfeng/0000-0002-0346-6071;RESEARCH AND PRACTICE PROJECT OF HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHING REFORM OF HENAN PROVINCE, CHINA [2019SJGLX457];RESEARCH AND PRACTICE PROJECT OF HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHING REFORM OF HENAN PROVINCE, CHINA;This research was funded by RESEARCH AND PRACTICE PROJECT OF HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHING REFORM OF HENAN PROVINCE, CHINA, grant number 2019SJGLX457.;;45;3;3;2;18;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;OCT;2021;12;10;;;;;;;424;10.3390/info12100424;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info12100424;;;14;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;WS0PZ;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000714893500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies investigated how atoms impact code comprehension through the perspectives of time, accuracy, and opinions of developers. However, we need more studies evaluating other perspectives and the combination of these perspectives on a common ground through experiments. In our study, we evaluate how the eye tracking method can be used to gain new insights when we compare programs obfuscated by the atoms with functionally equivalent clarified versions. We conduct a controlled experiment with 32 novices in Python and measure their time, number of attempts, and visual effort with eye tracking through fixation duration, fixations count, and regressions count. We also conduct interviews and investigate the subjects' difficulties with the programs. In our results, the clarified version of the code with Operator Precedence reduced the time spent in the region that contains the atom to the extent of 38.6%, and the number of answer attempts by 28%. Most subjects found the obfuscated version more difficult to solve than the clarified one, and they reported the order of precedence to be difficult to validate. By analyzing their visual effort, in the obfuscated version, we observed an increase of 47.3% in the horizontal regressions count in the atom region, making its reading more difficult. The additional atoms evaluated revealed other interesting nuances. Based on our findings, we encourage researchers to consider eye tracking combined with other perspectives to evaluate atoms of confusion and educators to favor patterns that do not impact the understanding and visual effort of undergraduates.;"[da Costa, Jose Aldo Silva; Gheyi, Rohit; de Oliveira, Pablo Roberto Fernandes] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil; [Castor, Fernando] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ribeiro, Marcio; Fonseca, Baldoino] Univ Fed Alagoas, Maceio, Brazil";"Universidade Federal de Campina Grande; Utrecht University; Universidade Federal de Alagoas";da Costa, JAS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil.;"josealdo@copin.ufcg.edu.br; rohit@dsc.ufcg.edu.br; f.j.castordelimafilho@uu.nl; pablo@copin.ufcg.edu.br; marcio@ic.ufal.br; baldoino@ic.ufal.br";"Fonseca, Baldoino/JUV-2819-2023; Castor, Fernando/V-4011-2018";"Fonseca, Baldoino/0000-0002-0730-0319; Castor, Fernando/0000-0002-6389-3630; Silva da Costa, Jose Aldo/0000-0001-8918-1749";;;;;44;2;2;1;4;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

Syntax highlighting is one of the most common tools used to support developers in understanding algorithms. However, most research in this area originates from a time when programmers used a completely different tool chain. We examined the influence of syntax highlighting on novices' ability to comprehend source code. Additional analyses cover the influence of task type and programming experience on the code comprehension ability itself and its relation to syntax highlighting. We conducted a controlled experiment with 390 undergraduate students in an introductory Java programming course. We measured the correctness with which they solved small coding tasks. Each test subject received some tasks with syntax highlighting and some without. The data provided no evidence that syntax highlighting improves novices' ability to comprehend source code. There are very few similar experiments and it is unclear as of yet which factors impact the effectiveness of syntax highlighting. One major limitation may be the types of tasks chosen for this experiment. The results suggest that syntax highlighting squanders a feedback channel from the IDE to the programmer that can be used more effectively.;"[Hannebauer, Christoph; Hesenius, Marc; Gruhn, Volker] Univ Duisburg Essen, Paluno Ruhr Inst Software Technol, Essen, Germany";University of Duisburg Essen;Hannebauer, C (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Paluno Ruhr Inst Software Technol, Essen, Germany.;"christoph@hannebauer.name; marc.hesenius@uni-due.de; volker.gruhn@uni-due.de";;Hesenius, Marc/0000-0002-6826-9212;;;;;43;13;14;0;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

Our goal was to see if particular patterns within the snippet induced higher levels of cognitive load, and if the collected EEG data might provide more detailed insights than performance measures. Our results suggest that while cognitive load can be an influence on code comprehension performance, other human factors, such as a tendency to forget certain programming rules or to misread what the code is asking them to do may also play a role, particularly for novice programmers. We conclude that: (1) different types of code patterns can affect programmers' cognitive processes in disparate ways, (2) neither self-reported data nor brainwave activity alone is a reliable indicator of programmers' level of comprehension for all types of code snippets, (3) EEG techniques could be useful to better understand the relationships between program comprehension, code patterns and cognitive processes, and (4) tests like ours could be useful to identify crucial learning gaps in novice programmers, which, in turn can be leveraged to improve programming tools and teaching strategies.;"[Yeh, Martin K. -C.] Penn State Univ Brandywine, Informat Sci & Technol, Media, PA USA; [Yan, Yu] Univ Calif San Diego, Teaching Learning Commons, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Zhuang, Yanyan] Univ Colorado, Comp Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 USA; [DeLong, Lois Anne] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Brooklyn, NY USA";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering";Yeh, MKC (corresponding author), Penn State Brandywine, 207H Tomezsko Bldg,25 Yearsley Mill Rd, Media, PA 19063 USA.;martin.yeh@psu.edu;Yeh, Martin/AAD-4644-2020;Yeh, Martin/0000-0002-5630-1633;"Committee on Research and Creative Works (CRCW) award at the University of Colorado; National Science Foundation [1444827]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [1444827] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";"Committee on Research and Creative Works (CRCW) award at the University of Colorado; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))";This work was supported in part by a Committee on Research and Creative Works (CRCW) award at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, and by the National Science Foundation under Award No. 1444827.;;68;4;4;4;15;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0144-929X;1362-3001;;BEHAV INFORM TECHNOL;Behav.

This study extends existing work in computer programming on the use of diagrammatic representation for students undertaking the fundamental data structure course (CS2) in Malaysia. Students were tested on comprehension of diagrams followed by the composition of code with respect to the linked list topic. The data was assessed using the inter-rater agreement test and showed a high degree of consistent ratings. Results showed a moderate correlation between students? ability to analyze list operations in the form of notation and performance on code writing. Students assessed the diagrams differently according to the complexity level. The result can be generalized to conclude that the use of diagrams alone may not fully support reasoning and program solving. However, some types of diagrams are potentially more effective to support code composition and more emphasis should be given to evaluating the effectiveness of diagrams in organizing cues to facilitate novice programmers in program solving.

Code commenting is a common practice among developers to explain the purpose of the code in order to improve code comprehension and readability. Researchers investigated the effect of code comments on software development tasks and demonstrated the use of comments in several ways, including maintenance, reusability, bug detection, etc. Given the importance of code comments, it becomes vital for novice developers to brush up on their code commenting skills. In this study, we initially investigated what types of comments novice students document in their source code and further categorized those comments using a machine learning approach. The work involves the initial manual classification of code comments and then building a machine learning model to classify student code comments automatically. The findings of our study revealed that novice developers/students' comments are mainly related to Literal (26.66%) and Insufficient (26.66%). Further, we proposed and extended the taxonomy of such source code comments by adding a few more categories, i.e., License (5.18%), Profile (4.80%), Irrelevant (4.80%), Commented Code (4.44%), Autogenerated (1.48%), and Improper (1.10%). Moreover, we assessed our approach with three different machine-learning classifiers. Our implementation of machine learning models found that Decision Tree resulted in the overall highest accuracy, i.e., 85%. This study helps in predicting the type of code comments for a novice developer using a machine learning approach that can be implemented to generate automated feedback for students, thus saving teachers time for manual one-on-one feedback, which is a time-consuming activity.;"[Niazi, Tahira; Khan, Sumra; Wasi, Shaukat] Mohammad Ali Jinnah Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi 75400, Pakistan; [Das, Teerath] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Ahmed, Ghufran] Natl Univ Comp Emerging Sci, Sch Comp, Karachi 75400, Pakistan; [Waqas, Syed Muhammad] Bahria Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karachi 75260, Pakistan; [Khan, Suleman] Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Psychol & Comp Sci, Preston PR1 2HE, England; [Abdelatif, Ahmed Abdelaziz] Khawarizmi Int Coll, Al Bahya, Abu Dhabi 25669, U Arab Emirates";"Mohammad Ali Jinnah University; University of Jyvaskyla; University of Central Lancashire";Khan, S (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Sch Psychol & Comp Sci, Preston PR1 2HE, England.;skhan92@uclan.ac.uk;Wasi, Shaukat/AAG-4616-2021;Wasi, Shaukat/0000-0003-3660-065X;;;;;36;0;0;0;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1999-4893;;ALGORITHMS;Algorithms;JAN;2023;16;1;;;;;;;53;10.3390/a16010053;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a16010053;;;19;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;7X7VL;;Green Accepted, Green Published, gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000914405100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper describes research introducing CS1 students to programming concepts using a Scratch programming language guided visual execution environment (VEE). The concepts addressed are those from an introductory programming course (sequences, variables, operators, conditionals, loops, and events and parallelism). The VEE guides novice students through programming concepts, explaining and guiding interactive exercises executed in Scratch by using metaphors and serious games. The objective of this study is, firstly, to investigate if a cohort of 124 CS1 students, from three distinct groups, studying at the same university, are able to improve their programming skills guided by the VEE. Secondly, is the improvement different for various programming concepts? All the CS1 students were taught the module by the same tutor in four 2-h sessions (8 h), and a qualitative research approach was adopted. The results show students significantly improved their programming knowledge, and this improvement is significant for all the programming concepts, although greater for certain concepts such as operators, conditionals, and loops than others. It also shows that students lacked initial knowledge of events and parallelism, though most had used Scratch during their high school years. The sequence concept was the most popular concept known to them. A collateral finding in this study is how the students' previous knowledge and learning gaps affected grades they required to access and begin study at the university level.;"[Hijon-Neira, Raquel; Palacios-Alonso, Daniel; Borras-Gene, Oriol] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Comp Sci, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Connolly, Cornelia] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Educ, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland; [Connolly, Cornelia] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, SFI Ctr Software Res, Lero, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland";Universidad Rey Juan Carlos;"Connolly, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Educ, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland.;Connolly, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Galway, SFI Ctr Software Res, Lero, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland.";"raquel.hijon@urjc.es; cornelia.connolly@nuigalway.ie; daniel.palacios@urjc.es; oriol.borras@urjc.es";"Borrás-Gené, Oriol/A-3712-2015; Connolly, Cornelia/AAA-4912-2019; Hijon Neira, Raquel/G-8214-2015";"Borrás-Gené, Oriol/0000-0002-1866-1857; Connolly, Cornelia/0000-0001-9778-5569; Palacios-Alonso, Daniel/0000-0001-6063-4898; Hijon Neira, Raquel/0000-0003-3833-4228";"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R]; Rey Juan Carlos University [30VCPIGI15]; Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM [P2018/TCS-4307]; FSE; FEDER";"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Rey Juan Carlos University; Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM; FSE(European Social Fund (ESF)); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government)";This research was funded by in part by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad under Grant TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R, in part by the Rey Juan Carlos University under Grant 30VCPIGI15, in part by the Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM, under Grant P2018/TCS-4307, and in part by the Structural Funds (FSE and FEDER).;;54;2;2;1;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;SEP;2021;12;9;;;;;;;378;10.3390/info12090378;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info12090378;;;15;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;UV7JR;;Green Published, gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000699650200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye -tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demon-strates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students' use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. In the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students' online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. They could also examine the effects of SRL strategies training on students' motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities.;"[Cheng, Gary] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math & Informat Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zou, Di] Lingnan Univ, Ctr English & Addit Languages, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xie, Haoran] Lingnan Univ, Dept Comp & Decis Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fu Lee] Hong Kong Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Lingnan University; Lingnan University; Hong Kong Metropolitan University";Cheng, G (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math & Informat Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;chengks@eduhk.hk;Xie, Haoran/AFS-3515-2022;"Xie, Haoran/0000-0003-0965-3617; ZOU, Di/0000-0001-8435-9739; Wang, Fu Lee/0000-0002-3976-0053; Cheng, Gary/0000-0002-5614-3348";"General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [18601118]; Education University of Hong Kong [MIT/DRG05/22-23, RG 6/2022-2034R]";"General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council; Education University of Hong Kong";"This work was financially supported by the General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Research Grants Council [grant number 18601118]; and The Education University of Hong Kong [grant numbers MIT/DRG05/22-23, RG 6/2022-2034R].";;76;3;3;52;79;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Different from professional programmers, novice programmers usually refers to programmers who have learned a programming language for about three years. At this stage, measuring their programming ability is of great significance to improve their programming abilities. In previous work, researchers have proposed a variety of ways to measure programming ability for professional programmers. We set out to find out the best way to measure novice programming ability. We first exacted a questionnaire from published comprehension experiments for measuring programming ability. Then, we performed control experiments to compare the answers to the questionnaire with their performance. We found that module number and the number of programming-related websites visited seem to be a reliable way to measure programming ability for novice programmers. Furthermore, we perform exploratory factor analysis to generate a model to verify the effectiveness of our findings.;"[Wang, Xue; Wang, Yong; Le, Wenge; Wang, Shouhang] Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Comp & Informat, Wuhu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Fei] Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Minjiang Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Informat Proc & Intelligent C, Fujian, Peoples R China";"Anhui Polytechnic University; Nanjing University; Zhejiang Laboratory; Minjiang University";"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Comp & Informat, Wuhu, Peoples R China.;Wang, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Wang, Y (corresponding author), Minjiang Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Informat Proc & Intelligent C, Fujian, Peoples R China.";"2200720102@stu.ahpu.edu.cn; yongwang@ahpu.edu.cn; yangf@zhejianglab.com; 2200220114@stu.ahpu.edu.cn; 2200220107@stu.ahpu.edu.cn";Wang, Yong/HLW-0025-2023;Wang, Yong/0000-0002-2719-1017;"Anhui Natural Science Foundation [1908085MF183, 61976005, 61772270]; NSFC of China, Training Program for Young and Middle-aged Top Talents of Anhui Polytechnic University [201812]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ21F020004]; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology (Nanjing University) Research Program [KFKT2019B23]; Open Research Fund of Anhui Key Laboratory of Detection Technology and Energy Saving Devices, Anhui Polytechnic University [DTESD2020B03]; Anhui Province Quality Engineering Teaching and Research Key Project [2019jyxm0216, 2018jyxm0025]; Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control (Minjiang University) [MJUKF-IPIC202109]";"Anhui Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); NSFC of China, Training Program for Young and Middle-aged Top Talents of Anhui Polytechnic University; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology (Nanjing University) Research Program; Open Research Fund of Anhui Key Laboratory of Detection Technology and Energy Saving Devices, Anhui Polytechnic University; Anhui Province Quality Engineering Teaching and Research Key Project; Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control (Minjiang University)";This work was supported by the Anhui Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 1908085MF183) , Project 61976005, 61772270 supported by NSFC of China, Training Program for Young and Middle-aged Top Talents of Anhui Polytechnic University (Grant No. 201812) , Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. LQ21F020004, State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology (Nanjing University) Research Program (Grant No. KFKT2019B23) , the Open Research Fund of Anhui Key Laboratory of Detection Technology and Energy Saving Devices, Anhui Polytechnic University (Grant No. DTESD2020B03) , Anhui Province Quality Engineering Teaching and Research Key Project (Grant No. 2019jyxm0216, 2018jyxm0025) and Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control (Minjiang University) (Grant No. MJUKF-IPIC202109) .;;20;0;0;5;21;LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV;HUALIEN;LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV, HUALIEN, 00000, TAIWAN;1607-9264;2079-4029;;J INTERNET TECHNOL;J.

However, due to the lack of experience with algorithm design, or software development, individual novice programmers face challenges while reviewing code. In this paper, we utilize collaborative eye tracking to record the gaze data from multiple reviewers, and share the gaze visualization among them during the code review process. The visualizations, such as borders highlighting current reviewed code lines, transition lines connecting related reviewed code lines, reveal the visual attention about program functions that can facilitate understanding and bug tracing. This can help novice reviewers to make sense to confirm the potential bugs or avoid repeated reviewing of code, and potentially even help to improve reviewing skills. We built a prototype system, and conducted a user study with paired reviewers. The results showed that the shared real-time visualization allowed the reviewers to find bugs more efficiently.;"[Cheng, Shiwei; Wang, Jialing; Shen, Xiaoquan; Chen, Yijian] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China; [Dey, Anind] Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Seattle, WA 98195 USA";"Zhejiang University of Technology; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle";Cheng, SW (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China.;swc@zjut.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772468, 62172368]; National Key Research AMP; Development Program of China [2016YFB1001403]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang [RF-B2019001]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research AMP; Development Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang";We thank all the volunteers who took part in the user studies, and all the reviewers who wrote and provided helpful comments on previous versions of this paper.

Conditional compilation with #ifdef annotations allows developers to flexibly introduce variability in their programs. Developers can use disciplined annotations, entirely enclosing full statements with preprocessor directives, or undisciplined ones, enclosing only parts of the statements. Despite some debate, there is no consensus on whether a developer should use exclusively disciplined annotations. While one prior study found undisciplined annotations more time-consuming and error-prone, another study found no difference between disciplined and undisciplined annotations regarding task completion time and accuracy. In this article, we evaluate whether three fine-grained refactorings to discipline #ifdef annotations correlate with improvements in code comprehension and visual effort with an eye tracker. We conduct a controlled experiment with 64 human subjects who were majoritarily novices in the C programming language. We observed statistically significant differences for two refactorings to discipline annotations with respect to the analyzed metrics (time, fixation duration, fixation count, and regressions count) in the code regions changed by each refactoring.;"[Silva da Costa, Jose Aldo; Gheyi, Rohit] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Marcio; Fonseca, Baldoino] Univ Fed Alagoas, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil; [Apel, Sven] Saarland Univ, Saarland Informat Campus, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Vander Alves] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Medeiros, Flavio] Fed Inst Alagoas, Maceio, Alagoas, Brazil; [Garcia, Alessandro] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil";"Universidade Federal de Campina Grande; Universidade Federal de Alagoas; Saarland University; Universidade de Brasilia; Instituto Federal de Alagoas (IFAL); Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro";da Costa, JAS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil.;"josealdo@copin.ufcg.edu.br; rohit@dsc.ufcg.edu.br; marcio@ic.ufal.br; apel@cs.uni-saarland.de; valves@unb.br; baldoino@ic.ufal.br; flavio.medeiros@ifal.edu.br; afgarcia@inf.puc-rio.br";Fonseca, Baldoino/JUV-2819-2023;"Fonseca, Baldoino/0000-0002-0730-0319; Silva da Costa, Jose Aldo/0000-0001-8918-1749";"CAPES [117875, 175956]; FAPEAL [60030.0000000462/2020]; CNPq [426005/2018-0, 421306/2018-1, 309844/2018-5, 311442/2019-6, 310757/2018-5, 427787/2018-1]; FAPDF [00193-00000926/2019-67]";"CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPEAL(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Alagoas (FAPEAL)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPDF(Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF))";We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers, Rafael Mello, and Rodrigo Bonifacio for their insightful comments.

To encourage self-studies of Java programming, we have developed a Web-based Java Programming Learning Assistant system (JPLAS). JPLAS provides several types of exercises to cover different levels. However, any type does not question grammar concepts of a source code directly, although it can be the first step for novice students. In this paper, we propose a Grammar-Concept Understanding Problem (GUP) as a new type in JPLAS. A GUP instance consists of a source code and a set of questions on grammar concepts or behaviors of the code. Each answer can be a number, a word, or a short sentence, whose correctness is marked through string matching with the correct one. We present the algorithm to automatically generate a GUP instance from a given source code by: 1) extracting the registered keywords in the code, 2) selecting the registered question corresponding to each keyword, and 3) detecting the data required in the correct answer from the code. As for evaluations, we first generate 20 GUP instances with a total of 99 questions from simple codes on fundamental Java grammar, and assign them to 100 university students in Indonesia. On the other hand, we additionally generate 8 instances with a total of 30 questions, and assign all the instances to 29 undergraduates in Myanmar as the comparative study. The results show that the proposal is effective to improve the performance of the students who are novices in Java programming.;"[Aung, Soe Thandar; Funabiki, Nobuo; Syaifudin, Yan Watequlis; Kyaw, Htoo Htoo Sandi] Okayama Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Okayama, Japan; [Aung, Shune Lae; Dim, Nem Khan] Univ Yangon, Dept Comp Studies, Yangon, Myanmar; [Kao, Wen-Chung] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei, Taiwan";"Okayama University; University of Yangon; National Taiwan Normal University";Funabiki, N (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Okayama, Japan.;"funabiki@okayama-u.ac.jp; shunelaeaung@gmail.com; jungkao@ntnu.edu.tw";Syaifudin, Yan Watequlis/J-9477-2017;"Syaifudin, Yan Watequlis/0000-0001-6582-3495; /0009-0002-6378-0617";;;;;15;6;7;0;3;ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHING;ROWLAND HEIGHTS;2448 DESIRE AVE, ROWLAND HEIGHTS, CA 91748 USA;1798-2340;;;J ADV INFORM TECHNOL;J.

In such cases, developers use cues to establish the relevance of a piece of information with a task. Being familiar with different kinds of cues will help the developers to comprehend a program faster. But unlike the experienced developers, novice developers fail to recognize the relevant cues, because (a) there are many cues and (b) they might be unfamiliar with the artifacts. However, not much is known about the developers' choice of cue. Hence, we conducted two independent studies to understand the kind of cues used by the developers and how a tool influences their cue selection. First, from our user study on two common comprehension tasks, we found that developers actively seek the cues and their cue source choices are similar but task dependent. In our second exploratory study, we investigated whether an integrated development environment (IDE) influences a developer's cue choices. By observing their interaction history while fixing bugs in Eclipse IDE, we found that the IDE's influence on their cue choices was not statistically significant. Finally, as a case in point, we propose a novel task-specific program summarization approach to aid novice developers in comprehending an unfamiliar program. Our approach used developers cue choices to synthesize the summaries. A comparison of the synthesized summaries with the summaries recorded by the developers shows both had similar content. This promising result encourages us to explore task-specific cue models, which can aid novice developers to accomplish complex comprehension tasks faster.;"[Kulkarni, Naveen; Varma, Vasudeva] Int Inst Informat Technol IIIT H, Software Engn Res Ctr, Hyderabad 500032, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Kulkarni, Naveen] Infosys Ltd, Bengaluru, India";"International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad; Infosys Limited";"Kulkarni, N (corresponding author), Int Inst Informat Technol IIIT H, Software Engn Res Ctr, Hyderabad 500032, Andhra Pradesh, India.;Kulkarni, N (corresponding author), Infosys Ltd, Bengaluru, India.";"naveen.kulkarni@research.iiit.ac.in; vv@iiit.ac.in";Varma, Vasudeva/AIB-4832-2022;Varma, Vasudeva/0000-0003-1923-1725;;;;;45;2;2;0;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0963-9314;1573-1367;;SOFTWARE QUAL J;Softw.

Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers' changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.;"[Rich, Peter J.; Mason, Stacie L.] 150K MCKB Brigham Young Univ Provo, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [O'Leary, Jared] BootUp Profess Dev 1936 Pk Ln W, Orem, UT 84058 USA";;Rich, PJ (corresponding author), 150K MCKB Brigham Young Univ Provo, Provo, UT 84602 USA.;"peter_rich@byu.edu; stemason@gmail.com; jared@bootuppd.org";Rich, Peter/M-1769-2016;Rich, Peter/0000-0002-0039-966X;BootUp;BootUp;Funding for this research was provided by BootUp.

Equivalence (also known as bioequivalence in pharmacological studies) is a statistical approach that answers the question is product T equivalent to some other reference product R within some range ?. The approach of null hypothesis significance test used traditionally in Empirical Software Engineering seeks to assess evidence for differences between T and R, not equivalence. In this paper, we explain how EHT can be applied in Software Engineering, thereby extending it from its current application within pharmacological studies, to Empirical Software Engineering. We illustrate the application of EHT to Empirical Software Engineering, by re-examining the behavior of experts and novices when handling code with side effects compared to side-effect free code; a study previously investigated using traditional statistical testing. We also review two other previous published data of software engineering experiments: a dataset compared the comprehension of UML and OML specifications, and the last dataset studied the differences between the specification methods UML-B and B. The application of EHT allows us to extract additional conclusions to the previous results. EHT has an important application in Empirical Software Engineering, which motivate its wider adoption and use: EHT can be used to assess the statistical confidence with which we can claim that two software engineering methods, algorithms of techniques, are equivalent.";"[Javier Dolado, Jose] UPV EHU Univ Basque Country, Fac Informat, San Sebastian, Spain; [Carmen Otero, Mari] UPV EHU Univ Basque Country, Escuela Univ Ingn Vitoria Gasteiz, Vitoria, Spain; [Harman, Mark] UCL, CREST, London WC1E 6BT, England";"University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country; University of London; University College London";Dolado, JJ (corresponding author), UPV EHU Univ Basque Country, Fac Informat, San Sebastian, Spain.;"javier.dolado@ehu.es; mariacarmen.otero@ehu.es; m.harman@cs.ucl.ac.uk";Dolado, José Javier/I-5402-2015;"Dolado, José Javier/0000-0002-3301-5650; Harman, Mark/0000-0002-5864-4488; Otero Vidal, Mari Carmen/0000-0002-5321-9271";;;;;51;6;10;0;17;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0963-9314;1573-1367;;SOFTWARE QUAL J;Softw.

One way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend - such as nested loops. It is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an Expert Artificial Intelligence Task that is worth investigating. In this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in Python for practice using a context-free grammar. We defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. Algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. Each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. We checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the Python interpreter. The first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. Furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). The results of the evaluation show that over 82% of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at:https://tinyurl.com/nestedloops2021.

Documentation and program source code could be the first aspect in software system's understanding and its inner work-flow. This understanding of code is known as Program Comprehension (PC). With the advancement in technology and rapid growth in industry, information systems require frequent changes. This change need to be implement a specific idea or behavior which is named as Concept. Concept (variable, class, method) is referred as a typical behavior of code performing specific functionality like a student enrollment in student portal. In large scale systems, to locate the concept in the code is a very challenging task which require massive amount of time if performed in conventional ways. The conventional ways mean start finding the location by going through each and every file of the code. Programmer tries to locate these concepts with the help of domain knowledge using concept location techniques like static, dynamic and textual concept location technique. In this paper, we focused on static concept location technique and proposed a hybrid model for concept location in program comprehension.;"[Ali, Anas] Univ Lahore, Dept Comp Sci & IT, Lahore, Pakistan; [Khan, Ahmad Salman] Univ Lahore, Dept Software Engn, Lahore, Pakistan";"University of Lahore; University of Lahore";Ali, A (corresponding author), Univ Lahore, Dept Comp Sci & IT, Lahore, Pakistan.;;Ghouri, Anas Ali/AAB-8281-2020;Ghouri, Anas Ali/0000-0003-2908-3316;;;;;36;0;0;0;2;INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS;SEOUL;DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA;1738-7906;;;INT J COMPUT SCI NET;Int.

Instructors need to understand the student's difficulties to provide precise feedback on most frequent mistakes and to shape, design and effectively drive the course. This paper proposes and evaluates an approach allowing to analyze student's source code and to automatically generate feedback about the more common violations of the produced code. The approach is implemented through a cloud-based tool allowing to monitor how students use language constructs based on the analysis of the most common violations of the Object-Oriented paradigm in the student source code. Moreover, the tool supports the generation of reports about student's mistakes and misconceptions that can be used to improve the students' education. The paper reports the results of a quasi-experiment performed in a class of a CS1 course to investigate the effects of the provided reports in terms of coding ability (concerning the correctness and the quality of the produced source code). Results show that after the course the treatment group obtained higher scores and produced better source code than the control group following the feedback provided by the teachers.;"[Ardimento, Pasquale] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Comp Sci Dept, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Bernardi, Mario Luca] Univ Sannio, Dept Engn, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Cimitile, Marta] Unitelma Sapienza Univ, Dept Law & Econ, I-00161 Rome, Italy";"Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Sannio; Universita degli Studi di Roma Unitelma Sapienza";Ardimento, P (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Comp Sci Dept, I-70125 Bari, Italy.;pasquale.ardimento@uniba.it;"Ardimento, Pasquale/V-1406-2019; Bernardi, Mario Luca/T-1539-2019; CIMITILE, Marta/F-2083-2018";"Ardimento, Pasquale/0000-0001-6134-2993; Bernardi, Mario Luca/0000-0002-3223-7032; CIMITILE, Marta/0000-0003-2403-8313";;;;;57;4;4;1;4;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;132171;132187;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010172;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010172;;;17;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";MQ6FQ;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000552989200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although Q&A forums serve as a good resource for seeking help from developers beyond the local team, the abundance of information can cause developers, especially novice software engineers, to spend considerable time in identifying relevant answers and suitable suggested fixes. This exploratory study aims to understand how novice software engineers direct their efforts and what kinds of information they focus on within a post selected from the results returned in response to a search query on Stack Overflow. The results can be leveraged to improve the Q&A forum interface, guide tools for mining forums, and potentially improve granularity of traceability mappings involving forum posts. We qualitatively analyze the novice software engineers' perceptions from a survey as well as their annotations of a set of Stack Overflow posts. Our results indicate that novice software engineers pay attention to only 27% of code and 15-21% of text in a Stack Overflow post to understand and determine how to apply the relevant information to their context. Our results also discern the kinds of information prominent in that focus. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

On the effectiveness of novice and professional developers;INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Code smell identification; Collaboration; Empirical study";BAD;Context: The code smell identification aims to reveal code structures that harm the software maintainability. Such identification usually requires a deep understanding of multiple parts of a system. Unfortunately, developers in charge of identifying code smells individually can struggle to identify, confirm, and refute code smell suspects. Developers may reduce their struggle by identifying code smells in pairs through the collaborative smell identification. Objective: The current knowledge on the effectiveness of collaborative smell identification remains limited. Some scenarios were not explored by previous work on effectiveness of collaborative versus individual smell identification. In this paper, we address a particular scenario that reflects various organizations worldwide. We also compare our study results with recent studies. Method: We have carefully designed and conducted a controlled experiment with 34 developers. We exploited a particular scenario that reflects various organizations: novices and professionals inspecting systems they are unfamiliar with. We expect to minimize some critical threats to validity of previous work. Additionally, we interviewed 5 project leaders aimed to understand the potential adoption of the collaborative smell identification in practice. Results: Statistical testing suggests 27% more precision and 36% more recall through the collaborative smell identification for both novices and professionals. These results partially confirm previous work in a not previously exploited scenario. Additionally, the interviews showed that leaders would strongly adopt the collaborative smell identification. However, some organization and tool constraints may limit such adoption. We derived recommendations to organizations concerned about adopting the collaborative smell identification in practice. Conclusion: We recommend that organizations allocate novice developers for identifying code smells in collaboration. Thus, these organizations can promote the knowledge sharing and the correct smell identification. We also recommend the allocation of developers that are unfamiliar with the system for identifying smells. Thus, organizations can allocate more experience developers in more critical tasks.;"[Oliveira, Roberto; de Mello, Rafael; Fernandes, Eduardo; Garcia, Alessandro; Lucena, Carlos] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Oliveira, Roberto] State Univ Goias UEG, Posse, GO, Brazil";Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro;"Oliveira, R (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro PUC Rio, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;Oliveira, R (corresponding author), State Univ Goias UEG, Posse, GO, Brazil.";"roberto.oliveira@ueg.br; rmaiani@inf.puc-rio.br; emfernandes@inf.puc-rio.br; afgarcia@inf.puc-rio.br; lucena@inf.puc-rio.br";"de Mello, Rafael/AAF-9910-2021; Lucena, Carlos/GQP-2277-2022; Fernandes, Eduardo/F-8555-2017";"de Mello, Rafael/0000-0002-9877-3946; Fernandes, Eduardo/0000-0002-1222-2247; Oliveira, Roberto/0000-0003-3153-4761";"CNPq [434969/2018-4, 312149/2016-6, 409536/2017-2]; CAPES/Procad [175956]; FAPERJ [22520-7/2016]";"CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); CAPES/Procad(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ))";This work was partially funded by CNPq (grants 434969/2018-4, 312149/2016-6, and 409536/2017-2), CAPES/Procad (grant 175956), and FAPERJ (grant 22520-7/2016).;;58;11;13;0;2;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0950-5849;1873-6025;;INFORM SOFTWARE TECH;Inf.

Inductive logic programming uses logic programming to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques. Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge. In earlier work, the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic rules for simple classification tasks. In a later study, it was found that the presentation of machine-learned explanations to humans can produce both beneficial and harmful effects in the context of game learning. We continue our investigation of comprehensibility by examining the effects of the ordering of concept presentations on human comprehension. In this work, we examine the explanatory effects of curriculum order and the presence of machine-learned explanations for sequential problem-solving. We show that (1) there exist tasks A and B such that learning A before learning B results in better comprehension for humans in comparison to learning B before learning A and (2) there exist tasks A and B such that the presence of explanations when learning A contributes to improved human comprehension when subsequently learning B. We propose a framework for the effects of sequential teaching on comprehension based on an existing definition of comprehensibility and provide evidence for support from data collected in human trials. Our empirical study involves curricula that teach novices the merge sort algorithm. Our results show that sequential teaching of concepts with increasing complexity (a) has a beneficial effect on human comprehension and (b) leads to human re-discovery of divide-and-conquer problem-solving strategies, and (c) allows adaptations of human problem-solving strategy with better performance when machine-learned explanations are also presented.;"[Ai, Lun; Muggleton, Stephen H.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London, England; [Langer, Johannes] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany; [Schmid, Ute] Univ Bamberg, Cognit Syst Grp, Bamberg, Germany";"Imperial College London; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg";Ai, L (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London, England.;"lun.ai15@imperial.ac.uk; johannes-miran.langer@stud.uni-bamberg.de; s.muggleton@imperial.ac.uk; ute.schmid@uni-bamberg.de";Ai, Lun/ITT-4718-2023;Ai, Lun/0000-0003-2731-482X;"TAILOR - EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under GA [952215]; UK's EPSRC Human-Like Computing Network";"TAILOR - EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under GA; UK's EPSRC Human-Like Computing Network";This research was partially supported by TAILOR, a project funded by EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under GA No. 952215.

Aggregating evidence from 12 controlled experiments;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Aggregation; Heterogeneity; Unified modeling language; Controlled experiments";"DIAGRAMS; MAINTENANCE; FAMILY; DOCUMENTATION; TRACEABILITY; BENEFITS; IMPACT";In this paper, we present the results of long-term research conducted in order to study the contribution made by software models based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to the comprehensibility of Java source-code deprived of comments. We have conducted 12 controlled experiments in different experimental contexts and on different sites with participants with different levels of expertise (i.e., Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD students and software practitioners from Italy and Spain). A total of 333 observations were obtained from these experiments. The UML models in our experiments were those produced in the analysis and design phases. The models produced in the analysis phase were created with the objective of abstracting the environment in which the software will work (i.e., the problem domain), while those produced in the design phase were created with the goal of abstracting implementation aspects of the software (i.e., the solution/application domain). Source-code comprehensibility was assessed with regard to correctness of understanding, time taken to accomplish the comprehension tasks, and efficiency as regards accomplishing those tasks. In order to study the global effect of UML models on source-code comprehensibility, we aggregated results from the individual experiments using a meta-analysis. We made every effort to account for the heterogeneity of our experiments when aggregating the results obtained from them. The overall results suggest that the use of UML models affects the comprehensibility of source-code, when it is deprived of comments. Indeed, models produced in the analysis phase might reduce source-code comprehensibility, while increasing the time taken to complete comprehension tasks. That is, browsing source code and this kind of models together negatively impacts on the time taken to complete comprehension tasks without having a positive effect on the comprehensibility of source code. One plausible justification for this is that the UML models produced in the analysis phase focus on the problem domain. That is, models produced in the analysis phase say nothing about source code and there should be no expectation that they would, in any way, be beneficial to comprehensibility. On the other hand, UML models produced in the design phase improve source-code comprehensibility. One possible justification for this result is that models produced in the design phase are more focused on implementation details. Therefore, although the participants had more material to read and browse, this additional effort was paid back in the form of an improved comprehension of source code.;"[Scanniello, Giuseppe] Univ Basilicata, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Potenza, Italy; [Gravino, Carmine; Risi, Michele] Univ Salerno, Dept Comp Sci, Fisciano, Italy; [Tortora, Genoveffa] Univ Salerno, Fac Math Phys & Nat Sci, Fisciano, Italy; [Tortora, Genoveffa] Univ Salerno, Fisciano, Italy; [Genero, Marcela] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Technol & Informat Syst, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Genero, Marcela] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Dodero, Gabriella] Free Univ Bozen, Bolzano, Italy";"University of Basilicata; University of Salerno; University of Salerno; University of Salerno; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano";Gravino, C (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dept Comp Sci, Fisciano, Italy.;"giuseppe.scanniello@unibas.it; gravino@unisa.it; marcela.genero@uclm.es; joseantonio.cruz@uclm.es; tortora@unisa.it; mrisi@unisa.it; Gabriella.Dodero@unibz.it";"Tortora, Genoveffa/M-8155-2019; Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./B-7299-2015; GENERO, MARCELA/L-6480-2014";"Cruz-Lemus, Jose A./0000-0002-0470-609X; Scanniello, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0024-7508; GENERO, MARCELA/0000-0002-6868-7465";"SEQUOIA Project - Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [TIN2015-63502-C3-1-R]; Ministerio de Econom/ y Competitividad";"SEQUOIA Project - Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional; Ministerio de Econom/ y Competitividad";The authors would like to thank the participants in the experiments and all the people who supported the research presented in this paper.

We propose the use of process mining to learn coding behavior from event logs captured from a customized Integrated Development Environment, concerning interactions with both such an environment and a Version Control System. In particular, by using an incremental approach, the discovered model can be refined after every single development session, which avoids the need to for the model to learn from scratch from previous sessions. It would also allow one to provide the programmer timely suggestions to improve their performance. In this paper, we applied off-line incremental behavior, so as to be able to analyze it at several levels of depth and at different moments. As a preliminary evaluation of our approach, we investigated the coding activities of six novice students of a Java academic programming course working on a programming case study. The results provide some useful information about the initial difficulties in coding activities faced by programmers and show that their coding behavior could be considered as formed after a development task requiring approximately 4000 rows of code.;"[Ardimento, Pasquale; Redavid, Domenico; Ferilli, Stefano] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Comp Sci, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Bernardi, Mario Luca] Univ Sannio, Dept Engn, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Cimitile, Marta] Unitelma Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, I-00185 Rome, Italy";"Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Sannio; Universita degli Studi di Roma Unitelma Sapienza";"Ardimento, P; Ferilli, S (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Comp Sci, I-70125 Bari, Italy.";"pasquale.ardimento@uniba.it; bernardi@unisannio.it; marta.cimitile@unitelmasapienza.it; domenico.redavid1@uniba.it; stefano.ferilli@uniba.it";"Redavid, Domenico/GQB-0318-2022; Redavid, Domenico/JAX-3133-2023; CIMITILE, Marta/F-2083-2018; Ferilli, Stefano/E-8841-2014";"Redavid, Domenico/0000-0003-2196-7598; Redavid, Domenico/0000-0003-2196-7598; Ardimento, Pasquale/0000-0001-6134-2993; BERNARDI, Mario Luca/0000-0002-3223-7032; CIMITILE, Marta/0000-0003-2403-8313; Ferilli, Stefano/0000-0003-1118-0601";;;;;34;2;2;1;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;FEB;2022;11;3;;;;;;;389;10.3390/electronics11030389;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11030389;;;17;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";YZ2GZ;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000755301100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The use of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) makes the experience a complicated process because these IDEs focus on professional programmers and not on novice learners. This also affects the classrooms of the university Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso (PUCV) (Chile). The use of professional IDEs negatively affects the learning process of first-year students who face the development of the algorithms for the first time. One of the IDE widely used for teaching programming courses is Code::Blocks, which is a tool for professional developers. Through a heuristic and usability evaluation, we found that Code::Blocks has a complex user interface and a functional overload. Using these two findings, as well as recommendations given during these tests, we highlight the important aspects that an IDE for novice learners should have. Taking into account previous observations and state-of-the-art/practice of IDEs, a functional IDE prototype, named Incre-IDLE, is developed. In addition to Code::Blocks evaluations, this paper reports the results of a heuristic and usability evaluation applied to first-year students at PUCV about functionalities provided by Incre-IDLE. These results suggest that Incre-IDLE has a simple interface, is easy to install and use, and does not have functional overload (i.e., spend a considerable amount of time learning the tool). Concretely, the results show that 66.7% of the students could complete tasks easily and 100% of them found the GUI intuitive. In terms of GUI, 83.3% considered the application interface very simple; and the text, concepts, and icons very understandable by 66.7%. The students also found the tool motivating (66.7%) or very motivating (33.3%). These results closely match the findings obtained by the heuristic evaluation of Incre-IDLE from the experts: 83.3% of them rated it as useful or very useful, and only a 16.7% rated it as";"[Salinas, Matias; Figueroa, Ismael] Pragmat Labs, Coquimbo, Chile; [Leger, Paul; Duarte, Vannessa] Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ingn, Coquimbo, Chile; [Fukuda, Hiroaki] Shibaura Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Cardozo, Nicolas] Univ Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Duarte, Vannessa] Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ciencias Empresariales, Coquimbo, Chile";"Universidad Catolica del Norte; Shibaura Institute of Technology; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad Catolica del Norte";Salinas, M (corresponding author), Pragmat Labs, Coquimbo, Chile.;"madasaso@gmail.com; pleger@ucn.cl; hiroaki@shibaura-it.ac.jp; n.cardozo@uniandes.edu.cl; vannessa.duarte@ucn.cl; ifigueroap@gmail.com";"Leger, Paul/Q-6174-2017; Figueroa, Ismael/O-6048-2017";"Leger, Paul/0000-0003-0969-5139; Fukuda, Hiroaki/0000-0003-1228-3186; Figueroa, Ismael/0000-0003-3661-4963; Cardozo, Nicolas/0000-0003-1565-4106";;;;;40;0;0;1;2;GRAZ UNIV TECHNOLGOY, INST INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPUTER MEDIA-IICM;GRAZ;INFFELDGASSE 16C, GRAZ, A-8010, AUSTRIA;0948-695X;0948-6968;;J UNIVERS COMPUT SCI;J.

Writing functional programs is a cognitive skill, which many students, novices in programming, find it difficult to master. It is equally challenging to assess this ability of students. Research has shown that students need to learn how to read and understand, before they can learn to write programs. Code tracing questions are a suitable way to assess the knowledge of semantics of programming constructs (understanding what programs do). However, when designing these types of questions, teachers need to be aware of the complexity of the code and must always try to create questions with code snippets of same or similar complexity, especially when preparing different versions of the same test (for large student groups). In this paper we propose a new model for smart automatic generation of code tracing questions. The model uses a suitable source code metric to measure the code complexity, and to enable generation of questions containing code snippets of consistent complexity. We also introduce CodeCPP: a newly developed Moodle plugin, which is an implementation of the proposed model. The evaluation of CodeCPP, through a year-long use of the system in teaching programming as well as feedback from selected teachers with many years of experience in teaching programming courses, shows positive and promising results. The system utilization confirms that the application of the proposed model enables a fair and objective knowledge assessment. Furthermore, the feedback provided by teachers and students is highly positive.;"[Stankov, Emil; Jovanov, Mile; Bogdanova, Ana Madevska] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje, North Macedonia";Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje;Stankov, E (corresponding author), Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje, North Macedonia.;emil.stankov@finki.ukim.mk;Bogdanova, Ana Madevska/P-6901-2014;Jovanov, Mile/0000-0001-8540-7309;"Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, at Ss; Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje";"Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, at Ss; Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje";The research presented in this paper is partly supported by the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, at Ss.

However, readability is inherently subjective and dependent on the knowledge and experience of the reader analyzing the code. This paper assesses the readability of Python code statements commonly used in undergraduate programming courses. Our readability model is based on tracking the reader's eye movement during the while-read phase. It uses machine learning (ML) techniques and relies on a novel set of features-observational features-that capture how the readers read the code. We experimented by tracking the eye movement of 90 undergraduate students while assessing the readability of 48 Python code snippets. We trained an ML model that predicts readability based on the collected observational data and the code snippet's structural and textual features. In our experiments, the XGBoost classifier trained using observational features exclusively achieved the best results (0.85 F-measure). Using correlation analysis, we identified Python statements most affecting readability for undergraduate students and proposed implications for teaching Python programming. In line with findings for Java language, we found that constructs related to the code's size and complexity hurt the code's readability. Numerous comments also hindered readability, potentially due to their association with less readable code. Some Python-specific statements (list comprehension, lambda function, and dictionary comprehension) harmed code readability, even though they were part of the curriculum. Tracking students' gaze indicated some additional factors, most notably nonlinearity introduced by if, for, while, try, and function call statements.;"[Segedinac, Milan; Savic, Goran; Zeljkovic, Ivana; Slivka, Jelena] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Konjovic, Zora] Singidunum Univ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Savic, Goran] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia";"University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad";Savic, G (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.;savicg@uns.ac.rs;;Savic, Goran/0000-0002-3917-5487;"Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia [6521051]; Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation [451-03-47/2023-01/200156]; AI-Clean CaDET";"Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia; Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation; AI-Clean CaDET";This research was supported by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, Grant No 6521051, AI-Clean CaDET and the Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation through project no. 451-03-47/2023-01/200156 Innovative scientific and artistic research from the FTS (activity) domain.;;30;0;0;13;20;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

However, this study departs from previous works in examining a more direct method of using psycho-physiological sensors data to detect the difficulty of program comprehension tasks and programmer level of expertise. By conducting a study with 38 expert and novice programmers, we investigated how well an electroencephalography and an eye-tracker can be utilized in predicting programmer expertise (novice/expert) and task difficulty (easy/difficult). Using data from both sensors, we could predict task difficulty and programmer level of expertise with 64.9 and 97.7% precision and 68.6 and 96.4% recall, respectively. The result shows it is possible to predict the perceived difficulty of a task and expertise level for developers using psycho-physiological sensors data.

This paper presents STRANGE, an investigation module that exclusively explains code similarities in natural language (English and Indonesian). For the purpose of reusability, STRANGE can be embedded in JPlag and other code similarity detection tools. It can also act as a standalone tool for measuring source code similarity. Our evaluation shows that STRANGE is more helpful than JPlag in the investigation process since it explains the similarities in natural language. Further, its effectiveness is comparable to that of JPlag but higher on trivial disguises of the sort that novice students will tend to apply when disguising copied code.;"[Karnalim, Oscar; Simon] Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Karnalim, Oscar] Maranatha Christian Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Bandung 40164, Indonesia";"University of Newcastle; Universitas Kristen Maranatha";"Karnalim, O (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.;Karnalim, O (corresponding author), Maranatha Christian Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Bandung 40164, Indonesia.";oscar.karnalim@uon.edu.au;"Karnalim, Oscar/F-9133-2018; , Simon/G-7364-2013";"Karnalim, Oscar/0000-0003-4930-6249; , Simon/0000-0003-2285-283X";University of Newcastle, Australia;University of Newcastle, Australia;This work was supported by the University of Newcastle, Australia.;;54;7;7;0;11;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2021;9;;;;;;59935;59948;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3073703;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3073703;;;14;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";RQ9VU;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000642759900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Educators are also more aware of this situation and incorporate teaching security in their respective fields. An effective application of this is only possible by cultivating the teaching and learning perspectives. Understanding the security awareness and practice of students is useful as an initial step to create a baseline for teaching methods and content. In this paper, we first survey to investigate how students approach security and what could motivate them to learn and apply security practices. Then, we analyze the source code for 6 semesters of coding assignments for 2 tasks using a source code vulnerability analysis tool. In our analysis, we report the types of vulnerabilities and various aspects between them while incorporating the effect of student grades. We then explore the lexical and structural features of security in student code using data analysis and machine learning. For the lexical analysis, we build a classifier to extract informative features and for the structural analysis, we utilize Syntax Trees to represent code and perform clustering in terms of structural features where clusters themselves yield different vulnerability levels.

This paper discusses research carried out using a Java-based visual execution environment (VEE) to introduce fundamental programming concepts to CS1 students. The VEE guides beginner programmers through the fundamentals of programming, utilizing visual metaphors to explain and direct interactive tasks implemented in Java. The study's goal was to determine if the use of the VEE in the instruction of a group of 63 CS1 students from four different groups enrolled in two academic institutions (based in Madrid, Spain and Galway, Ireland) results in an improvement in their grasp of fundamental programming concepts. The programming concepts covered included those typically found in an introductory programming course, e.g., input and output, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, recursion, and files. A secondary goal of this research was to examine if the use of the VEE enhances students' understanding of particular concepts more than others, i.e., whether there exists a topic-dependent benefit to the use of the VEE. The results of the study found that use of the VEE in the instruction of these students resulted in a significant improvement in their grasp of fundamental programming concepts compared with a control group who received instruction without the use of the VEE. The study also found a pronounced improvement in the students' grasp of particular concepts (e.g., operators, conditionals, and loops), suggesting the presence of a topic-dependent benefit to the use of the VEE.;"[Hijon-Neira, Raquel; Paredes-Barragan, Pedro] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Comp Sci Dept, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Pizarro, Celeste] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Appl Math Dept, Mostoles 28933, Madrid, Spain; [French, John; Duignan, Michael] Atlantic Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Phys, Galway H91T8NW, Ireland";"Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Atlantic Technological University (ATU)";Hijón-Neira, R (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Comp Sci Dept, Madrid 28032, Spain.;"raquel.hijon@urjc.es; celeste.pizarro@urjc.es; john.french@atu.ie; pedro.paredes@urjc.es; michael.duignan@atu.ie";"; Hijon Neira, Raquel/G-8214-2015; Pizarro, Celeste/K-5037-2012";"French, John/0009-0006-3342-1268; Hijon Neira, Raquel/0000-0003-3833-4228; Pizarro, Celeste/0000-0003-2447-8239; PAREDES BARRAGAN, PEDRO/0000-0002-2320-9515";Spanish Ministry of Universities' Jos Castillejo Program for Mobility Stays Abroad for Young Doctors;Spanish Ministry of Universities' Jos Castillejo Program for Mobility Stays Abroad for Young Doctors;No Statement Available;;45;1;1;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;OCT;2023;14;10;;;;;;;579;10.3390/info14100579;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info14100579;;;14;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;AO4M3;;gold, Green Submitted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001119393100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We discuss a technique of recording concerns using source code annotations (concern annotations). Using two studies and two controlled experiments, we seek to answer the following 3 research questions: (1) Do programmers' mental models overlap? (2) How do developers use shared concern annotations when they are available? (3) Does using annotations created by others improve program comprehension and maintenance correctness, time and confidence? The first study shows that developers' mental models, recorded using concern annotations, overlap and thus can be shared. The second study shows that shared concern annotations can be used during program comprehension for the following purposes: hypotheses confirmation, feature location, obtaining new knowledge, finding relationships and maintenance notes. The first controlled experiment with students showed that the presence of annotations significantly reduced program comprehension and maintenance time by 34%. The second controlled experiment was a differentiated replication of the first one, focused on industrial developers. It showed a 33% significant improvement in correctness. We conclude that concern annotations are a viable way to share developers' thoughts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Measuring program comprehension is not a trivial task. In fact, different studies use self-reported and various psycho-physiological measures as proxies. In this research, we propose a methodology using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking devices as an objective measure of program comprehension that allows researchers to conduct studies in environments close to real world settings, at identifier level of granularity. We validate our methodology and apply it to study the impact of lexical, structural, and readability issues on developers' cognitive load during bug localization tasks. Our study involves 25 undergraduate and graduate students and 21 metrics. Results show that the existence of lexical inconsistencies in the source code significantly increases the cognitive load experienced by participants not only on identifiers involved in the inconsistencies but also throughout the entire code snippet. We did not find statistical evidence that structural inconsistencies increase the average cognitive load that participants experience, however, both types of inconsistencies result in lower performance in terms of time and success rate. Finally, we observe that self-reported task difficulty, cognitive load, and fixation duration do not correlate and appear to be measuring different aspects of task difficulty.;"[Fakhoury, Sarah; Roy, Devjeet; Arnaoudova, Venera] Washington State Univ, Sch EECS, SEL Lab, 355 NE Spokane St,Sloan 326, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Ma, Yuzhan] Amazon, Washington, DC USA; [Adesope, Olusola] Washington State Univ, Coll Educ, Pullman, WA 99164 USA";"Washington State University; Amazon.com; Washington State University";"Fakhoury, S; Arnaoudova, V (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch EECS, SEL Lab, 355 NE Spokane St,Sloan 326, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.";"sarah.fakhoury@wsu.edu; devjeet.roy@wsu.edu; yuzhanm@amazon.com; venera.arnaoudova@wsu.edu; olusola.adesope@wsu.edu";;Arnaoudova, Venera/0000-0001-8036-4557;;;;;63;23;23;1;16;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

This work explores how using static analysis tools in programming assignments can provide insight into student behavior and performance. The use of three static analysis tools in the assignments of an introductory programming course has been analyzed. Our findings confirm previous work regarding that formatting and documentation issues are the most common issues found in student code, that this is constant regardless of major and performance in the course and that there are certain error types which are more correlated with performance. We also found that total error frequency in the course correlates with final course grade and that the presence of any kind of error in final submissions correlates with low performance on exams. Furthermore, we found females to produce less documentation and style errors than males and students who partner to produce less errors in general than students working alone. Our results also raise concerns on the use of certain metrics for assessing the difficulty of fixing errors by students.;"[Albluwi, Ibrahim] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Salter, Joseph] Quartet Hlth, Caldwell, NJ USA";Princeton University;Albluwi, I (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;"isma@cs.princeton.edu; joesalter17@gmail.com";;;;;;;55;1;1;0;0;Princess Sumaya Univ & SRSF;Amman;Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT), Khalil Saket Street 118, Amman, JORDAN;2413-9351;2415-1076;;JORDAN J COMPUT INFO;Jordanian J.

There is a large body of research on software measurement, but the actual factors that make software easier to read or easier to comprehend are not well understood. In the present study, we investigate the role of method chains and code comments in software readability and comprehension. Our analysis comprises data from 104 students with varying programming experience. Readability and comprehension were measured by perceived readability, reading time and performance on a simple cloze test. Regarding perceived readability, our results show statistically significant differences between comment variants, but not between method chain variants. Regarding comprehension, there are no significant differences between method chain or comment variants. Student groups with low and high experience, respectively, show significant differences in perceived readability and performance on the cloze tests. Our results do not show any significant relationships between perceived readability and the other measures taken in the present study. Perceived readability might therefore be insufficient as the sole measure of software readability or comprehension. We also did not find any statistically significant relationships between size and perceived readability, reading time and comprehension.;"[Borstler, Jurgen] Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Software Engn, S-37179 Karlskrona, Sweden; [Paech, Barbara] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Comp Sci, D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany";"Blekinge Institute Technology; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg";Börstler, J (corresponding author), Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Software Engn, S-37179 Karlskrona, Sweden.;"jurgen.borstler@bth.se; paech@informatik.uni-heidelberg.de";"Börstler, Jürgen/IWE-4001-2023; Paech, Barbara/AAI-5997-2020";"Börstler, Jürgen/0000-0003-0639-4234;";;;;;57;25;27;0;4;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;0098-5589;1939-3520;;IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG;IEEE Trans.

The underlying concepts are inherently abstract, making them especially difficult to understand for novice programmers. This paper proposes a cognitively challenging technique to help students understand the thought process that the learning outcomes of fundamental data structure units aim to achieve. The development of this thought process is using a technique we term Visual Kinesthetic Pseudocode, with the overarching goal of helping students code without coding, yet providing the necessary scaffold to guide them in implementing the data structures with real code. This was implemented in the form of InteractiveDS, an app for students and teachers to guide the learning of fundamental data structure concepts. The evaluations demonstrate that students strongly credited InteractiveDS in aiding their understanding of concepts and confidence in applying data structure concepts in practice. The study is also a step forward in revealing potential threshold concepts pertaining to data structure modules.

Most source code mining efforts aim at the source code of projects, which are usually large and standardized, but less for student programs. There are two differences between project codes and student programs. On the one hand, some work on project codes is based on relatively single information, which is far from enough for student programs. Because student programs are relatively small, which makes them contain less information. Consequently, it is necessary to mine as much information as possible in student programs. On the other hand, the variable or function naming and the structure of the student programs are usually irregular, as compared with the source codes of projects. To learn from student programs, we proposed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based model, which integrates data flow and function call information to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and applies an improved GNN model to the integrated graph to achieve the state-of-art student program classification accuracy. The experiment results have shown that the proposed work can classify student programs with accuracy over 97%.;"[Lu, M.; Wang, Y.; Tan, D.] Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Zhao, L.] Cent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China";"Central South University; Central South University";Lu, M (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.;mingminglu@csu.edu.cn;;lu, ming ming/0000-0002-3932-7890;"National Science Foundation of China [61232001, 61173169, 91646115, 60903222]; Science Foundation of Hunan [2016JJ2149, 018JJ3012]; Major Science and Technology Research Program for Strategic Emerging Industry of Hunan [2012GK4054]";"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation of Hunan; Major Science and Technology Research Program for Strategic Emerging Industry of Hunan";This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China, under Project 61232001, Project 61173169, Project 91646115, and Project 60903222, in part by the Science Foundation of Hunan, under Project 2016JJ2149 and Project 018JJ3012, and in part by the Major Science and Technology Research Program for Strategic Emerging Industry of Hunan, under Grant 2012GK4054.;;27;3;3;0;9;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2021;9;;;;;;87857;87868;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063475;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063475;;;12;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";TJ2IQ;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000673312400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Developers often compose source code identifiers with abbreviated words and acronyms, and do not always use consistent mechanisms and explicit separators when creating identifiers. Such choices and inconsistencies impede the work of developers that must understand identifiers by decomposing them into their component terms, and mapping them onto dictionary, application or domain words. When software documentation is scarce, outdated or simply not available, developers must therefore use the available contextual information to understand the source code. This paper aims at investigating how developers split and expand source code identifiers, and, specifically, the extent to which different kinds of contextual information could support such a task. In particular, we consider (i) an internal context consisting of the content of functions and source code files in which the identifiers are located, and (ii) an external context involving external documentation. We conducted a family of two experiments with 63 participants, including bachelor, master, Ph.D. students, and post-docs. We randomly sampled a set of 50 identifiers from a corpus of open source C programs and we asked participants to split and expand them with the availability (or not) of internal and external contexts. We report evidence on the usefulness of contextual information for identifier splitting and acronym/abbreviation expansion. We observe that the source code files are more helpful than just looking at function source code, and that the application-level contextual information does not help any further. The availability of external sources of information only helps in some circumstances. Also, in some cases, we observe that participants better expanded acronyms than abbreviations, although in most cases both exhibit the same level of accuracy. Finally, results indicated that the knowledge of English plays a significant effect in identifier splitting/expansion. The obtained results confirm the conjecture that contextual information is useful in program comprehension, including when developers split and expand identifiers to understand them. We hypothesize that the integration of identifier splitting and expansion tools with IDE could help to improve developers' productivity.;"[Guerrouj, Latifa; Gueheneuc, Yann-Gael; Antoniol, Giuliano] Ecole Polytechnique Montreal, DGIGL, SOCCER Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Di Penta, Massimiliano] Univ Sannio, Sannio, Italy";"Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; University of Sannio";Guerrouj, L (corresponding author), Ecole Polytechnique Montreal, DGIGL, SOCCER Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;"latifa.guerrouj@polymtl.ca; dipenta@unisannio.it; yann-gael.gueheneuc@polymtl.ca; antoniol@ieee.org";"Guéhéneuc, Yann-Gaël/K-9371-2019; Di Penta, Massimiliano/AAF-9656-2021";Di Penta, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0340-9747;;;;;40;10;10;0;4;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

A number of quantitative empirical investigations have been conducted about this practice. The results are contrasting and inconclusive. In addition, previous studies fail to analyze the values, beliefs, and assumptions that inform and shape TDD. Objective: We present a study designed, and conducted to understand the values, beliefs, and assumptions about TDD. Participants were novice and professional software developers. Method: We conducted an ethnographically-informed study with 14 novice software developers, i.e., graduate students in Computer Science at the University of Basilicata, and six professional software developers (with one to 10 years work experience). The participants worked on the implementation of a new feature for an existing software written in Java. We immersed ourselves in the context of our study. We collected qualitative information by means of audio recordings, contemporaneous field notes, and other kinds of artifacts. We collected quantitative data from the integrated development environment to support or refute the ethnography results. Results: The main insights of our study can be summarized as follows: (i) refactoring (one of the phases of TDD) is not performed as often as the process requires and it is considered less important than other phases, (ii) the most important phase is implementation, (iii) unit tests are almost never up-to-date, and (iv) participants first build in their mind a sort of model of the source code to be implemented and only then write test cases. The analysis of the quantitative data supported the following qualitative findings: (i), and (iv). Conclusions: Developers write quick-and-dirty production code to pass the tests, do not update their tests often, and ignore refactoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Novice programmers face many barriers when learning programming. One of these barriers is syntax, which for many languages is not designed based on empirical evidence. The purpose of the experiment was to provide more empirical evidence on the subject, to find out if the results of the original experiment can be replicated and if conducting the experiment in an environment where English is not the native language affects the results. The results of our experiment replicated most of the findings of the original study and provided further evidence that some syntactic choices in many popular programming languages are unintuitive for novice programmers. Our results suggest that the native language of participants who otherwise had good English skills had little effect when compared to the original study.

A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of textual coding.

Understanding the machine can be easier when it is represented graphically, and tools have been developed to this end. However, these tools typically support only 1 programming language and do not work in a Web browser. In this article, we present the functionality and technical implementation of the 2 visualization tools. First, the language-agnostic and extensible Jsvee library helps instructors visualize notional machines and create expression-level program animations for online course materials. Second, instructors can use the Kelmu toolkit to augment automatically generated animations, for instance, by adding annotations such as textual explanations and arrows on top of the original animation. Both of these libraries have been used in introductory programming courses, and there is preliminary evidence that learners find the animations useful and annotated animations change student behavior.;[Sirkia, Teemu] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Espoo, Finland;Aalto University;Sirkiä, T (corresponding author), POB 15400, Aalto 00076, Finland.;teemu.sirkia@aalto.fi;Sirkiä, Teemu/AAM-8548-2020;Sirkiä, Teemu/0000-0003-4415-6966;;;;;21;11;12;0;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2047-7473;2047-7481;;J SOFTW-EVOL PROC;J.

Code consists of mostly natural language text, both in identifiers and comments, and it is a particular form of text. Nevertheless, the models proposed to estimate code readability take into account only structural aspects and visual nuances of source code, such as line length and alignment of characters. In this paper, we extend our previous work in which we use textual features to improve code readability models. We introduce 2 new textual features, and we reassess the readability prediction power of readability models on more than 600 code snippets manually evaluated, in terms of readability, by 5K+ people. We also replicate a study by Buse and Weimer on the correlation between readability and FindBugs warnings, evaluating different models on 20 software systems, for a total of 3M lines of code. The results demonstrate that (1) textual features complement other features and (2) a model containing all the features achieves a significantly higher accuracy as compared with all the other state-of-the-art models. Also, readability estimation resulting from a more accurate model, ie, the combined model, is able to predict more accurately FindBugs warnings.;"[Scalabrino, Simone; Oliveto, Rocco] Univ Molise, Pesche, IS, Italy; [Linares-Vasquez, Mario] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Poshyvanyk, Denys] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA USA";"University of Molise; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); William & Mary";Scalabrino, S (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Pesche, IS, Italy.;simone.scalabrino@unimol.it;Scalabrino, Simone/AAC-7669-2019;"Scalabrino, Simone/0000-0003-1764-9685; Poshyvanyk, Denys/0000-0002-5626-7586";;;;;55;56;59;0;6;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2047-7473;2047-7481;;J SOFTW-EVOL PROC;J.

Such labels can be obtained using various approaches, including Information Retrieval (IR) methods or other simple heuristics. They provide a bird-eye's view of the source code, allowing developers to look over software components fast and make more informed decisions on which parts of the source code they need to analyze in detail. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to verify whether the extracted labels make sense to software developers. This paper investigates (i) to what extent various IR techniques and other simple heuristics overlap with (and differ from) labeling performed by humans; (ii) what kinds of source code terms do humans use when labeling software artifacts; and (iii) what factors-in particular what characteristics of the artifacts to be labeled-influence the performance of automatic labeling techniques. We conducted two experiments in which we asked a group of students (38 in total) to label 20 classes from two Java software systems, JHotDraw and eXVantage. Then, we analyzed to what extent the words identified with an automated technique-including Vector Space Models, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), as well as customized heuristics extracting words from specific source code elements-overlap with those identified by humans. Results indicate that, in most cases, simpler automatic labeling techniques-based on the use of words extracted from class and method names as well as from class comments-better reflect human-based labeling. Indeed, clustering-based approaches (LSI and LDA) are more worthwhile to be used for source code artifacts having a high verbosity, as well as for artifacts requiring more effort to be manually labeled. The obtained results help to define guidelines on how to build effective automatic labeling techniques, and provide some insights on the actual usefulness of automatic labeling techniques during program comprehension tasks.";"[De Lucia, Andrea; Panichella, Annibale] Univ Salerno, Software Engn Lab, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Di Penta, Massimiliano; Panichella, Sebastiano] Univ Sannio, RCOST, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Oliveto, Rocco] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, IS, Italy";"University of Salerno; University of Sannio; University of Molise";Oliveto, R (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, IS, Italy.;"adelucia@unisa.it; dipenta@unisannio.it; rocco.oliveto@unimol.it; apanichella@unisa.it; spanichella@unisannio.it";"De Lucia, Andrea/AAG-6781-2020; Panichella, Annibale/AAJ-8443-2020; Di Penta, Massimiliano/AAF-9656-2021";"Panichella, Sebastiano/0000-0003-4120-626X; De Lucia, Andrea/0000-0002-4238-1425; Di Penta, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0340-9747";;;;;55;26;30;0;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

Although code understanding cannot be completely impeded, code obfuscation makes it more laborious and troublesome, so as to discourage or retard code tampering. Despite the extensive adoption of obfuscation, its assessment has been addressed indirectly either by using internal metrics or taking the point of view of code analysis, e.g., considering the associated computational complexity. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available user study that measures the cost of understanding obfuscated code from the point of view of a human attacker. Aim: this paper experimentally assesses the impact of code obfuscation on the capability of human subjects to understand and change source code. In particular, it considers code protected with two well-known code obfuscation techniques, i.e., identifier renaming and opaque predicates. Method: We have conducted a family of five controlled experiments, involving undergraduate and graduate students from four Universities. During the experiments, subjects had to perform comprehension or attack tasks on decompiled clients of two Java network-based applications, either obfuscated using one of the two techniques, or not. To assess and compare the obfuscation techniques, we measured the correctness and the efficiency of the performed task. Results: -at least for the tasks we considered-simpler techniques (i.e., identifier renaming) prove to be more effective than more complex ones (i.e., opaque predicates) in impeding subjects to complete attack tasks.;"[Ceccato, Mariano; Tonella, Paolo] Fdn Bruno Kessler, Cit, Trento, Italy; [Di Penta, Massimiliano] Univ Sannio, Dept Engn, Benevento, Italy; [Falcarin, Paolo] Univ E London, Sch Architecture Comp & Engn, London E15 4LZ, England; [Ricca, Filippo] Univ Genoa, DIBRIS, Genoa, Italy; [Torchiano, Marco] Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy";"Fondazione Bruno Kessler; University of Sannio; University of East London; University of Genoa; Polytechnic University of Turin";Ceccato, M (corresponding author), Fdn Bruno Kessler, Cit, Trento, Italy.;"ceccato@fbk.eu; dipenta@unisannio.it; falcarin@uel.ac.uk; filippo.ricca@disi.unige.it; marco.torchiano@polito.it; tonella@fbk.eu";"Di Penta, Massimiliano/AAF-9656-2021; Ricca, Filippo/ABB-3276-2020; Ceccato, Mariano/T-7139-2019; Tonella, Paolo/C-1702-2015; Falcarin, Paolo/B-6635-2015";"Ceccato, Mariano/0000-0001-7325-0316; Torchiano, Marco/0000-0001-5328-368X; Di Penta, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0340-9747; Tonella, Paolo/0000-0003-3088-0339; Falcarin, Paolo/0000-0003-1933-5348";;;;;33;49;54;0;17;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

Students use programming languages to write their programs. These computer programs (students or practitioners written) make computers artificially intelligent and perform the tasks needed by the users. Without these programs, the computer may be visioned as a pointless machine. As the premise of writing programs is situated with specific programming languages, enormous efforts have been made to develop and create programming languages. However, each program-ming language is domain-specific and has its nuances, syntax and seman-tics, with specific pros and cons. These language-specific details, including syntax and semantics, are significant hurdles for novice programmers. Also, the instructors of introductory programming courses find these language specificities as the biggest hurdle in students learning, where more focus is on syntax than logic development and actual implementation of the program. Considering the conceptual difficulty of programming languages and novice students' struggles with the language syntax, this paper describes the design and development of a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) of a programming language for the novice, newcomers and students who do not have computer science as their major. Due to its syntax proximity to daily conversations, this paper hypothesizes that this language will be easy to use and understand by novice programmers. This paper systematically designed the language by identifying themes from various existing programming languages (e.g., C, Python). Additionally, this paper surveyed computer science experts from industry and academia, where experts self-reported their satisfaction with the newly designed language. The results indicate that 93% of the experts reported satisfaction with the NewBee for novice, newcomer and non-Computer Sci-ence (CS) major students.;"[Qureshi, Muhammad Aasim] Bahria Univ Lahore, Dept Comp Sci, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Asif, Muhammad] Univ Bologna, Dept Law Sci & Technol, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Anwar, Saira] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Multidisciplinary Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA";"University of Bologna; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station";Qureshi, MA (corresponding author), Bahria Univ Lahore, Dept Comp Sci, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.;maasimq@hotmail.com;Asif, Muhammad/ADJ-2283-2022;"Asif, Muhammad/0000-0001-9580-5626; Qureshi, Muhammad Aasim/0000-0002-6312-5797";Texas A&M University, College Station, USA;Texas A&M University, College Station, USA;This material is based upon the work supported by the startup fund provided to Dr. Saira Anwar by Texas A&M University, College Station, USA.

However, such datasets are often of small scale and cover a small set of objects or categories. In addition, these datasets contain freehand sketches mostly from expert users, making it difficult to compare the drawings by expert and novice users, while such comparisons are critical in informing more effective sketch-based interfaces for either user groups. These observations motivate us to analyze how differently people with and without adequate drawing skills sketch 3D objects. We invited 70 novice users and 38 expert users to sketch 136 3D objects, which were presented as 362 images rendered from multiple views. This leads to a new dataset of 3,620 freehand multi-view sketches, which are registered with their corresponding 3D objects under certain views. Our dataset is an order of magnitude larger than the existing datasets. We analyze the collected data at three levels, i.e., sketchlevel, stroke-level, and pixel-level, under both spatial and temporal characteristics, and within and across groups of creators. We found that the drawings by professionals and novices show significant differences at stroke-level, both intrinsically and extrinsically. We demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset in two applications: (i) freehand-style sketch synthesis, and (ii) posing it as a potential benchmark for sketch-based 3D reconstruction.

Their behavior to analyze source code and develop mitigation techniques is not well understood. Our objective is to gain insight into the strategies and techniques from both novice and experienced developers. Proper understanding can help us to inform inexperienced coders to efficiently and accurately approach, discover, and mitigate security flaws. Our research relies upon eye tracking hardware and software to collect and analyze the eye gazes. Unlike existing approaches, we incorporate a wide range of tasks simultaneously reading documentation, writing code, and using security coding analysis tools. We analyze both static and dynamic (interactive) stimuli in a realistic software development environment. Our pictorial visualizations represent a coder's eye gazes that visually demonstrates their behavior and patterns. In addition, we provide the full context of the stimuli that a participant observed. This allows for investigating the behavior at a range of tasks for a single participant and between participants. Our secure coding tasks include reading documentation, reading source code, and writing source code for a web application as well as utilizing security code scanning tools. Our contributions also include (1) novel visualization techniques to present transitions among components within and between applications, and (2) presentations of coders' attention levels during secure coding by investigating the change of pupil sizes.

J;"Jbara, A; Feitelson, DG";;;;"Jbara, Ahmad; Feitelson, Dror G.";;;How programmers read regular code: a controlled experiment using eye tracking;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Eye-tracking; Controlled experiment; Code regularity; Software complexity";"MOVEMENTS; COMPREHENSION; FIXATIONS";Regular code, which includes repetitions of the same basic pattern, has been shown to have an effect on code comprehension: a regular function can be just as easy to comprehend as a non-regular one with the same functionality, despite being significantly longer and including more control constructs. It has been speculated that this effect is due to leveraging the understanding of the first instances to ease the understanding of repeated instances of the pattern. To verify and quantify this effect, we use eye tracking to measure the time and effort spent reading and understanding regular code. The experimental subjects were 18 students and 2 faculty members. The results are that time and effort invested in the initial code segments are indeed much larger than those spent on the later ones, and the decay in effort can be modeled by an exponential model. This shows that syntactic code complexity metrics (such as LOC and MCC) need to be made context-sensitive, e.g. by giving reduced weight to repeated segments according to their place in the sequence. However, it is not the case that repeated code segments are actually read more and more quickly. Rather, initial code segments receive more focus and are looked at more times, while later ones may be only skimmed. Further, a few recurring reading patterns have been identified, which together indicate that in general code reading is far from being purely linear, and exhibits significant variability across experimental subjects.;"[Jbara, Ahmad; Feitelson, Dror G.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Jbara, Ahmad] Netanya Acad Coll, Sch Math & Comp Sci, IL-42100 Netanya, Israel";Hebrew University of Jerusalem;"Jbara, A (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.;Jbara, A (corresponding author), Netanya Acad Coll, Sch Math & Comp Sci, IL-42100 Netanya, Israel.";"ahmadjbara@cs.huji.ac.il; feit@cs.huji.ac.il";;;ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [407/13];ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION(Israel Science Foundation);This research was supported by the ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (grant no. 407/13).

By examining code review and prose review using fMRI, we find that the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct. We can classify which task a participant is undertaking based solely on brain activity, and those task distinctions are modulated by expertise. We leverage insights from the psychological notion of spatial ability to decode the neural representations of several fundamental data structures and their manipulations using fMRI, fNIRS, and eye tracking. We examine list, array, tree, and mental rotation tasks and find that data structure and spatial operations use the same focal regions of the brain but to different degrees: they are related but distinct neural tasks.

However, in recent years, eye-tracking has been on the rise as a new method of collecting evidence of visual attention and the cognitive process of programmers. Eye-tracking has been used by researchers in the field of programming to analyze and understand a variety of tasks such as comprehension and debugging. In this article, we will focus on reporting how experiments that used eye-trackers in programming research are conducted, and the information that can be collected from these experiments. In this mapping study, we identify and report on 63 studies, published between 1990 and June 2017, collected and gathered via manual search on digital libraries and databases related to computer science and computer engineering. Among the five main areas of research interest are program comprehension and debugging, which received an increased interest in recent years, non-code comprehension, collaborative programming, and requirements traceability research, which had the fewest number of publications due to possible limitations of the eye-tracking technology in this type of experiments. We find that most of the participants in these studies were students and faculty members from institutions of higher learning, and while they performed programming tasks on a range of programming languages and programming representations, we find Java language and Unified Modeling Language (UML) representation to be the most used materials. We also report on a range of eye-trackers and attention tracking tools that have been utilized, and find Tobii eye-trackers to be the most used devices by researchers.;"[Obaidellah, Unaizah; Al Haek, Mohammed] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Cheng, Peter C. -H.] Univ Sussex, Sch Engn & Informat, Dept Informat, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England";"Universiti Malaya; University of Sussex";Obaidellah, U (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;"unaizah@um.edu.my; alhaekmohammed@gmail.com; p.c.h.cheng@sussex.ac.uk";"Obaidellah, Unaizah/M-2068-2016; Haek, Mohammed Al/K-3729-2019";"Obaidellah, Unaizah/0000-0003-4822-2174; Haek, Mohammed Al/0000-0002-0420-3572";"University of Malaya; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia [FP062-2014A, RP030C-14AET]";"University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya); Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)";This work is supported by the University of Malaya and Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, under grants FP062-2014A and RP030C-14AET.;;83;85;95;2;54;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;0360-0300;1557-7341;;ACM COMPUT SURV;ACM Comput.

Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role-playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both hi analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones.;"[Good, Judith; Howland, Kate] Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton, E Sussex, England";University of Sussex;Good, J (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;J.Good@sussex.ac.uk;;"Good, Judith/0000-0002-8317-9346; Howland, Kate/0000-0001-7394-4991";"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK [EP/G006989/1]; EPSRC [EP/G006989/1] Funding Source: UKRI";"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))";Thank you to the many teachers and young people who so willingly took part in our design work and evaluation studies, and to Keiron Nicholson for his work programming Flip.

The main goal in code comprehension is to extract information that is used in the software maintenance stage. Generating the structural model from the source code helps to alleviate the software maintenance cost. Software module clustering is thought to be a viable reverse engineering approach for building structural design models from source code. Finding the optimal clustering model is an NP-complete problem. The primary goals of this study are to minimize the number of connections between created clusters, enhance internal connections inside clusters, and enhance clustering quality. The previous approaches' main flaws were their poor success rates, instability, and inadequate modularization quality. The Olympiad optimization algorithm was introduced in this paper as a novel population-based and discrete heuristic algorithm for solving the software module clustering problem. This algorithm was inspired by the competition of a group of students to increase their knowledge and prepare for an Olympiad exam. The suggested algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, as well as local and global search methodologies. The effectiveness of the suggested Olympiad algorithm to solve the module clustering problem was evaluated using ten real-world and standard software benchmarks. According to the experimental results, on average, the modularization quality of the generated clustered models for the ten benchmarks is about 3.94 with 0.067 standard deviations. The proposed algorithm is superior to the prior algorithms in terms of modularization quality, convergence, and stability of results. Furthermore, the results of the experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm can be used to solve other discrete optimization problems efficiently. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Comparing C code responses across continents;SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Code comprehension; Empirical studies; C code snippets; Programming languages";"PROGRAM COMPREHENSION; COGNITIVE DOMAINS; LANGUAGE; DIFFERENCE; ATTENTION; KNOWLEDGE; THOUGHT";Recent studies have empirically validated the existence of small patterns in C code, named atoms of confusion (or atoms for short), that can interfere with program comprehension. The focus of this research is an attempt to see if these patterns in C would have a similar impact on a second group of participants who have similar levels of experience with C, but come from different places. We report on studies conducted with students from the USA and China. Both sets of participants were shown snippets of code and asked to predict the output. While performance measures (accuracy and speed) showed little difference in aggregate, a few individual atoms yielded surprising results. For example, we found examples where the clarified versions of code, with the atoms removed, were more confusing to the Chinese participants, despite the presence of atoms having much less impact on this group in general. These findings suggest that both the atoms themselves, and the processes used to remove them, may be viewed differently by individuals from different parts of the world. As such, developing insights on the cross-border applicability of coding practices could help create better pedagogical practices to prepare students for today's globally-integrated approach to software development.;"[Zhuang, Yanyan] Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Dept Comp Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA; [Yan, Yu] Univ Calif San Diego, Teaching Learning Commons, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Delong, Lois Anne] NYU, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Yeh, Martin K.] Penn State Univ Brandywine, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Media, PA 19063 USA";"University of Colorado System; University of Colorado at Colorado Springs; University of California System; University of California San Diego; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University";Zhuang, YY (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Colorado Springs, Dept Comp Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA.;"yzhuang@uccs.edu; yuyan@ucsd.edu; lad278@nyu.edu; martin.yeh@psu.edu";;;Committee on Research and Creative Works (CRCW);Committee on Research and Creative Works (CRCW);No Statement Available;;77;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0963-9314;1573-1367;;SOFTWARE QUAL J;Softw.

However there is a certain degree of difficulty in understanding a system represented by means of UML diagrams. Object: Our previous research demonstrates a significant improvement in understanding the structural aspects of a system represented as a UML class diagram when using a feedback-inclusive prototype of a model. This paper extends our previous work with an empirical validation study for the effectiveness of the feedback-inclusive rapid prototyping (FIRP) method, on the comprehension of system dynamics represented as multiple interacting UML statecharts. Because models often combine structural and behavioural views that are highly intertwined, we additionally evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to comprehension of the between-view consistency. Method: The FIRP environment was built following the principles of Design Science Research in Information Systems. This study targets the empirical validation of the effectiveness of the proposed technique using an experimental study method. Two experiments were conducted with the participation of 65 final-year master students in the context of different modelling courses from different study programs at KU Leuven using two two-group factorial experimental designs. The effectiveness of the FIRP method was measured by comparing students' performance between the cycles with and without the use of the method, using the understandability (comprehension test results) as the dependent variable and the use of FIRP as the independent variable. Effects from unknown variables were neutralized by means of randomized group compositions. The effectiveness of FIRP was additionally assessed with respect to personal characteristics (age, gender, previous knowledge, self-efficacy) and user acceptance (perceived ease of use, perceived utility, preference, satisfaction). Results: The findings reveal a significant positive impact of the use of the prototyping technique on students' comprehension of system dynamics represented as multiple interacting statecharts. Conclusions: The findings provide empirical support for the advantage of the use of FIRP over manual inspection of interacting statecharts. The findings also suggest that the method is suitable for training system's analysis and modelling skills when UML statecharts are involved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Operators of safety-critical systems learn to make decisions effectively throughout extensive training programs and many years of experience. In the domain of air traffic control, expensive training with high dropout rates calls for research to enhance novices' ability to detect and resolve conflicts in the airspace. While previous researchers have mostly focused on redesigning training instructions and programs, the current paper explores possible benefits of novel visual representations to improve novices' understanding of the situations as well as their decision-making process. We conduct an experimental evaluation study testing two ecological visual analytics interfaces, developed in a previous study, as support systems to facilitate novice decision-making. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we describe the application of an ecological interface design approach to the development of two visual analytics interfaces. Second, we perform a human-in-the-loop experiment with forty-five novices within a simplified air traffic control simulation environment. Third, by performing an expert-novice comparison we investigate the extent to which effects of the proposed interfaces can be attributed to the subjects' expertise. The results show that the proposed ecological visual analytics interfaces improved novices' understanding of the information about conflicts as well as their problem-solving performance. Further, the results show that the beneficial effects of the proposed interfaces were more attributable to the visual representations than the users' expertise.;"[Zohrevandi, E.; Westin, C. A.

Most introductory programming courses pay more attention to programming knowledge. This study introduces a PAAM model (Problem Analysis Algorithmic Model) in the teaching-learning process of the introductory programming (IP) course. The model focuses on problem statement requirements (input, output, and process) and problem-solving skills for novices. A web application was developed to offer the model in the course. Two surveys were conducted to collect the responses of IP students. Semistructured interviews were performed with the IP instructors. The final exam grades of the IP course over the last two semesters were compared to determine the impact of the PAAM model on the students gain. Results show that most students appreciated the model in the teaching-learning process of the course. The model helps students to develop problem-solving skills (p = .002), understand problem statement inputs (p = .003), process (p = .004), outputs (p = .034), and motivates them to learn programming (p = .031). The application impacts positively on students' behavior and attitude toward completing the programming exercises in the course.

When novice programmers are learning to implement these systems, they are required to deal with areas in which they do not have a deep knowledge. Furthermore, besides becoming proficient in these areas separately, they should integrate them and build a system whose components are heterogeneous from both software and hardware perspectives. The accurate understanding of the most challenging issues that novices face is fundamental to envision strategies aimed at easing the development of IoT systems. This paper focuses on identifying such issues in terms of software development tasks that novice programmers encounter when working on IoT systems. To this end, a survey was conducted among 40 novice developers that worked in groups developing IoT systems during several years of a university course. Based on their own experiences, individually and as a group, the most challenging development tasks were identified and prioritized over a common architecture, in terms of difficulty level and efforts. In addition, qualitative data about the causes of these issues was collected and analyzed. Finally, the paper offers critical insights and points out possible future work. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Such messages are typically too difficult for them to interpret without seeking help from colleagues or through online forums. Tackling this problem can help speed up their learning curves and hence increase their productivity. This paper proposes using natural language generation (NLG) techniques and the Rhetorical Structure Theory, which specifies how text spans are related and aggregated, to convert Java exception messages into readable and understandable natural language (NL) statements. An additional advantage is the possibility of adding more information and explanations that help students understand different exception types, their causes, and how they can be avoided. As a proof of concept, we developed Java Exceptions in the NL (JENL) tool to process Java exceptions using NLG techniques. Empirical evaluation has shown extreme satisfaction among Java programming subjects (including student novice programmers) with the capabilities of JENL as well as its usability.;"[Assiri, Fatmah Yousef; Elazhary, Hanan] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Assiri, Fatmah Yousef; Elazhary, Hanan] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Alfaysaleya Campus, Jeddah 21959, Saudi Arabia; [Elazhary, Hanan] Elect Res Inst, Comp & Syst Dept, Cairo, Egypt";"King Abdulaziz University; University of Jeddah; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Electronics Research Institute (ERI)";Assiri, FY (corresponding author), Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Alfaysaleya Campus, Jeddah 21959, Saudi Arabia.;fyassiri@uj.edu.sa;;Assiri, Fatmah/0000-0003-4959-5888;King Abdulaziz University Deanship of Scientific Research [J-2-558-39];King Abdulaziz University Deanship of Scientific Research;King Abdulaziz University Deanship of Scientific Research, Grant/Award Number: J-2-558-39;;34;0;0;0;8;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Programming assistance tools have been used to assist novice programmers extensively at education institutions. A programming assistance tool (PAT) is a software program that can be used by novice programmers to learn how to program and/or improve their understanding of programming concepts. This research proposes that novice programmers, specifically Information Technology (IT) scholars in South African secondary schools, could be supported by PATs. The main objective of this research was to determine whether the use of a PAT impacted IT scholars' understanding of programming concepts and their motivation towards programming in general. Criteria for the selection of PATs were derived from the programming difficulties identified in literature and from surveys to IT teachers and scholars. The selection criteria were grouped into programming knowledge and programming skills categories. Existing PATs were evaluated using the selection criteria and three PATs, namely, RoboMind, Scratch and B#, were selected for evaluation in this research study. A convenience sample of schools participated in the study. The three PATs provided different approaches while being able to support the Delphi programming language used in schools that participated in the study. The findings of this research indicated that, although scholars perceived the PATs to be useful in the explanation of certain of the programming concepts, there was no conclusive evidence that IT scholars who used a PAT had a significantly better understanding of programming concepts and motivation towards programming than scholars who did not use a PAT. Participant feedback was used to identify the strengths and shortcomings of the three PATs and to provide recommendations for the development of future PATs specifically designed to support IT scholars.

Human tutors recognize comprehension and non-comprehension states by interpreting learner non-verbal behavior (NVB). Experienced tutors adapt pedagogy, materials, and instruction to provide additional learning scaffold in the context of perceived learner comprehension. Near real-time assessment for e-learner comprehension of on-screen information could provide a powerful tool for both adaptation within intelligent e-learning platforms and appraisal of tutorial content for learning analytics. However, literature suggests that no existing method for automatic classification of learner comprehension by analysis of NVB can provide a practical solution in an e-learning, on-screen, context. This paper presents design, development, and evaluation of COMPASS, a novel near real-time comprehension classification system for use in detecting learner comprehension of on-screen information during e-learning activities. COMPASS uses a novel descriptive analysis of learner behavior, image processing techniques, and artificial neural networks to model and classify authentic comprehension indicative non-verbal behavior. This paper presents a study in which 44 undergraduate students answered on-screen multiple choice questions relating to computer programming. Using a front-facing USB web camera the behavior of the learner is recorded during reading and appraisal of on-screen information.

The goal of these approaches is to offer students a set of most relevant remedial examples when they have trouble solving a code comprehension problem where students examine a program code to determine its output or the final value of a variable. In this paper, we use the ideas of semantic-level similarity-based linking developed in the area of intelligent hypertext to generate examples for the given problem. To determine the best-performing approach, we explored two groups of similarity approaches for selecting examples: non-structural approaches focusing on examples that are similar to the problem in terms of concept coverage and structural approaches focusing on examples that are similar to the problem by the structure of the content. We also explored the value of personalized example recommendation based on student's knowledge levels and learning goal of the exercise.

However, while it is widely accepted that high quality matters in code comments just as it matters in source code, assessing comment quality in practice is still an open problem. First and foremost, there is no unique definition of quality when it comes to evaluating code comments. The few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of quality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and corresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming language, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals (e.g., Javadoc comments at the method level, or in-body comments describing TODOs to be addressed).In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the last decade of research in SE to answer the following research questions: (i) What types of comments do researchers focus on when assessing comment quality? (ii) What quality attributes (QAs) do they consider? (iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and (iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in general?Our evaluation, based on the analysis of 2353 papers and the actual review of 47 relevant ones, shows that (i) most studies and techniques focus on comments in Java code, thus may not be generalizable to other languages, and (ii) the analyzed studies focus on four main QAs of a total of 21 QAs identified in the literature, with a clear predominance of checking consistency between comments and the code. We observe that researchers rely on manual assessment and specific heuristics rather than the automated assessment of the comment quality attributes, with evaluations often involving surveys of students and the authors of the original studies but rarely professional developers.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Some provide software development with visual notations without source code, while others support programming with visual aids. Our research supports Java programming along with UML diagrams (class, object, and sequence) and dynamic execution traces of program synchronized in a web-based programming environment - JaguarCode. It aims to help students better understand the static structure and dynamic behavior of Java programs, as well as object-oriented design concepts. This paper reports on the evaluation results of JaguarCode to investigate its effectiveness and user satisfaction through quantitative and qualitative experiments. The experimental results revealed that having both static and dynamic visualizations did positively impact the correctness of program understanding and tracing problems, while the visual representations did affect students' understanding on the program execution of the problems to higher accuracy. It was also observed that students were satisfied with the aspects of those visualizations provided in JaguarCode.;"[Yang, Jeong; Lee, Young] Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Comp & Cyber Secur, San Antonio, TX 78224 USA; [Chang, Kai H.] Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Samuel Ginn Coll Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA";"Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University San Antonio; Auburn University System; Auburn University";Yang, J (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Comp & Cyber Secur, San Antonio, TX 78224 USA.;jeong.yang@tamusa.edu;Yang, Jeong/AAK-1285-2020;;;;;;29;7;9;0;11;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;0164-1212;1873-1228;;J SYST SOFTWARE;J.

Objective: To this end, we present an Eclipse plug-in for visualizing heterogeneous information, collected from multiple sources, at different levels of granularity. This visualization provides a single graphical representation of a system's change histories over multiple versions, allowing developers to identify the previous and present dependencies in the system, while adding new or removing and modifying the current functionalities of a software. Summarizing and associating the relevant changes in a single graph, further supports developers, not familiar with the overall system, to conduct a self-study and explore the systems design and changes of its functionality over time. Method: Our tool, DejaVu, initially infers and further visualizes change scenarios that have been applied to a given class in source code, across multiple versions of a software. DejaVu additionally augments the change information with prior commits from GitHub repositories, as well as associated issues from Jira issue tracking system. Evaluation: As part of the evaluation, we conducted a controlled experiment, recruiting participants with research or industrial programming experiences. The participants were asked to investigate and assess a set of change stories with and without the use of the DejaVu. As such, we empirically evaluated the impact of DejaVu in alleviating developers' understanding of code class-level changes across multiple versions. Results: Our results showed an average of 52% reduction in completion time and a 51% increase in correctness of several change-comprehension tasks once, users adopted DejaVu in comparison to the manual completion of the same tasks. A student's t-test verified the significant improvement in time and correctness of the tasks with p-values of 0.01 and 0.002. Conclusion: Visualizing aggregated information from multiple sources provides developers with a more comprehensive intuition of the change and its rationale, facilitating software maintenance tasks.

In literature, ways to measure or control programming experience vary. Often, researchers neglect it or do not specify how they controlled for it. We set out to find a well-defined understanding of programming experience and a way to measure it. From published comprehension experiments, we extracted questions that assess programming experience. In a controlled experiment, we compare the answers of computer-science students to these questions with their performance in solving program-comprehension tasks. We found that self estimation seems to be a reliable way to measure programming experience. Furthermore, we applied exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to extract and evaluate a model of programming experience.

However, traces are usually very large and hence they are difficult to interpret. Parallel, execution traces comprehension is a very important topic into the algorithms learning courses since it allows students to get a better understanding of the algorithm behavior. Therefore, there is a need to investigate ways to help students (and teachers) find and understand important information conveyed in a trace despite the trace being massive. In this paper, we propose a new approximation for execution traces comprehension based on fuzzy linguistic descriptions. A new methodology and a data-driven architecture based on linguistic modelling of complex phenomenon are presented and explained. In particular, they are applied to automatically generate linguistic reports from execution traces generated during the execution of algorithm implemented by the students of an introductory course of artificial intelligence. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that linguistic modelling of complex phenomenon is applied to execution traces comprehension. Throughout the article, it is shown how this kind of technology can be employed as a useful computer-assisted assessment tool that provides students and teachers with technical, immediate and personalised feedback about the algorithms that are being studied and implemented. At the same time, they provide us with two useful applications: they are an indispensable pedagogical resource for improving comprehension of execution traces, and they play an important role in the process of measuring and evaluating the believability of the agents implemented. To show and explore the possibilities of this new technology, a web platform has been designed and implemented by one of the authors, and it has been incorporated into the process of assessment of an introductory artificial intelligence course. Finally, an empirical evaluation to confirm our hypothesis was performed and a survey directed to the students was carried out to measure the quality of the learning-teaching process by using this methodology enriched with fuzzy linguistic descriptions.;"[Rubio-Manzano, Clemente] Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain; [Rubio-Manzano, Clemente; Lermanda Senoceain, Tomas; Vidal-Castro, Christian; Segura-Navarrete, Alejandra] Univ Bio Bio, Concepcion, Chile; [Martinez-Araneda, Claudia] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile";"Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad del Bio-Bio; Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion";"Rubio-Manzano, C (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain.;Rubio-Manzano, C (corresponding author), Univ Bio Bio, Concepcion, Chile.";clrubio@ubiobio.cl;"Martínez-Araneda, Claudia/AAA-8276-2022; Lermanda Senoceain, Tomás/AAN-9193-2020; Rubio Manzano, Clemente/P-8729-2016";"Lermanda Senoceain, Tomás/0000-0001-5821-0930; SEGURA NAVARRETE, alejandra andrea/0000-0001-9188-7919; Rubio Manzano, Clemente/0000-0001-5832-070X; Vidal-Castro, Christian/0000-0002-6881-5156; Martinez-Araneda, Claudia/0000-0003-0949-7415";University of Bio-Bio;University of Bio-Bio;This work has been performed in collaboration with the research group SOMOS (SOftware-MOdelling-Science) funded by the University of Bio-Bio.

However, parallel programming is more difficult than sequential programming. To alleviate the difficulties of parallel programming, high-level programming frameworks, such as OpenMP, have been proposed. Yet, there is evidence that novice parallel programmers make common mistakes that may lead to performance degradation or unexpected program behavior. In this paper, we present our cognitive parallel programming assistant (PAPA) that aims at educating and assisting novice parallel programmers to avoid common OpenMP mistakes. PAPA combines different IBM Watson services to provide a dialog-based interaction (through text and voice) for programmers. We use the Watson Conversation service to implement the dialog-based interaction, and the Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services to enable the voice interaction. The Watson Natural Language Understanding and WordsAPl Synonyms services are used to train PAPA with OpenMP-related publications.

At the same time, the participants' eye movements were recorded by an eye tracker to further understand the relationship between the program comprehension process and EEG activities. Experimental results show that the high-performance participants displayed higher performance for working memory (theta power), attention resource allocation (lower alpha power), and interaction between working memory and semantic memory (upper alpha power) in program comprehension tasks of complex constructs, which proves related theories proposed in the existing research on programming and cognition.

In the light of this, this paper proposes a tool, which allows students and professors to use Activity Cycle Diagrams (ACDs) to model systems with a comprehensive approach, focusing on the fundamental elements of simulation, allowing thereafter the corresponding simulation code to be extracted and experiments to be conducted. The tool is described and its applicability is demonstrated in some example cases.

J;"Flores, N; Aguiar, A";;;;"Flores, Nuno; Aguiar, Ademar";;;Learning Frameworks in a Social-Intensive Knowledge Environment - An Empirical Study;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Collaborative learning; frameworks; tools";ACQUISITION;Application frameworks are a powerful technique for large-scale reuse, but require a considerable effort to understand them. Good documentation is costly, as it needs to address different audiences with disparate learning needs. When code and documentation prove insuficient, developers turn to their network of experts. Nevertheless, this proves difficult, mainly due to the lack of expertise awareness (who to ask), wasteful interruptions of the wrong people and unavailability ( either due to intrusion or time constraints). The DRIVER platform is a collaborative learning environment where framework users can, in a non-intrusive way, store and share their learning knowledge while following the best practices of framework understanding (patterns). Developed by the authors, it provides a framework documentation repository, mounted on a wiki, where the learning paths of the community of learners can be captured, shared, rated, and recommended. Combining these social activities, the DRIVER platform promotes collaborative learning, mitigating intrusiveness, unavailability of experts and loss of tacit knowledge. This paper presents the assessment of DRIVER using a controlled academic experiment that measured the performance, effectiveness and framework knowledge intake of MSc students. The study concluded that, especially for novice learners, the platform allows for a faster and more effective learning process.;"[Flores, Nuno] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Informat Engn, Rua Roberto Frias S-N, Oporto, Portugal; Univ Porto, Fac Engn, INESC TEC, Rua Roberto Frias S-N, Oporto, Portugal";"Universidade do Porto; INESC TEC; Universidade do Porto";Flores, N (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Informat Engn, Rua Roberto Frias S-N, Oporto, Portugal.;"nuno.flores@fe.up.pt; ademar.aguiar@fe.up.pt";"Aguiar, Ademar/AAA-1740-2020; Flores, Nuno/D-8782-2015";"Aguiar, Ademar/0000-0002-4046-4729; Flores, Nuno/0000-0002-8258-0226";;;;;45;0;0;0;6;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0218-1940;1793-6403;;INT J SOFTW ENG KNOW;Int.

Previous research has shown that nonspeech sound can be useful in understanding the runtime behavior of a program. We explore the viability and advantages of using nonspeech sound in an ecological framework to help understand the static structure of software. We describe a novel concept for auditory display of program elements in which sounds indicate characteristics and relationships among a Java program's classes, interfaces, and methods. An empirical study employing this concept was used to evaluate 24 sighted software professionals and students performing maintenance-oriented tasks using a 2 x 2 crossover. Viability is strong for differentiation and characterization of software entities, less so for identification. The results suggest that sonification can be advantageous under certain conditions, though they do not indicate the overall advantage of using sound in terms of task duration at a 5% level of significance. The results uncover other findings such as differences in comprehension strategy based on the available tool environment. The participants reported enthusiasm for the idea of software sonification, mitigated by lack of familiarity with the concept and the brittleness of the tool. Limitations of the present research include restriction to particular types of comprehension tasks, a single sound mapping, a single programming language, and limited training time, but the use of sound in program comprehension shows sufficient promise for continued research.;"[Berman, Lewis] Digital Innovat Inc, 404 Selby Ct, Baltimore, MD 21212 USA; [Gallagher, Keith] Florida Inst Technol, Sch Comp, 150 West Univ Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Kozaitis, Suzanne] Florida Inst Technol, Evans Lib, 150 West Univ Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA";"Florida Institute of Technology; Florida Institute of Technology";Berman, L (corresponding author), Digital Innovat Inc, 404 Selby Ct, Baltimore, MD 21212 USA.;"lewis.berman@verizon.net; kgallagher@fit.edu; skozaiti@fit.edu";;;;;;;46;1;1;0;2;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1544-3558;1544-3965;;ACM T APPL PERCEPT;ACM Trans.

One of the main challenges with existing intelligent phishing detection approaches is that despite their promising detection rates they do not provide novice users with alerting mechanisms in order to enrich users' experience and knowledge of deceptive techniques. This paper proposes a new anti-phishing technique that not only detects phishing websites accurately, but also offers to novice users an alerting mechanism with rich rules. The key to success in the proposed anti-phishing technique are the features that have been developed by using a hybrid feature analysis. These provide visual cues in the web browser when phishing attacks occur. The rich rules are derived using a fuzzy rule induction approach and they can be utilized by the novice users to understand the security issues of the phishing problem. To evaluate the proposed technique, several experiments have been conducted using feature selection methods and classification algorithms (Furia, SMO, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, C4.5) against distinctive feature sets derived from a real phishing dataset. The results show that there are six features, which are not redundant, and when processed using Furia generate effective phishing detection models. More importantly, detection of these features is the basis of an alerting tool for pinpointing possible phishing attacks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These reading situations, called task-oriented reading, are challenging for students since they require specific skills that extend beyond basic reading comprehension skills. This is especially -pronounced when deep comprehension is required. Although many computer-based interventions have focused on teaching strategies to foster text comprehension, the role of strategy instruction in task-oriented reading has not been examined. In this study, we aim to ascertain the efficacy of an intervention based on task-oriented reading strategy instruction (TuinLECweb), in both text -base and situation model levels of comprehension, comparing it with training based on question -answering practice (AutoLEC). Moreover, we analyzed students' use of the instructional com-ponents and resources of the programs and the relationship to their efficacy. One hundred and thirty pupils attending sixth grade participated in this experimental pre-post study. The inter-vention comprised eight sessions in which students followed the training on their computers in the classroom. Results show that participants in both conditions raised their reading scores; however, while students in AutoLEC training obtained higher textbase scores, students in the TuinLECweb condition improved their situation model performance. Besides, gain in reading comprehension was not related to either instructional components or resources. These findings highlight the key role of strategy instruction in fostering deep comprehension when employing computer-based interventions in task-oriented reading.

The typical objective of developing an agent-based model is to either increase our mechanistic understanding of a real-world system, or to predict how the dynamics of the real-world system are likely to be affected by changes to internal or external factors. Although there are some excellent ABMs that have been used in a predictive capacity across a number of domains, we believe that the promotion of ABM as an 'accessible to all' approach, could potentially lead to models being published that are flawed and therefore generate inaccurate predictions of real-world systems. The purpose of this article is to use our experiences in modelling complex dynamical systems, to reinforce the view that agent-based models can be useful for answering questions of the real-world domain through predictive modelling, but also to emphasise that all modellers, expert and novice alike, must make a concerted effort to adopt robust methods and techniques for constructing, validating and analysing their models, if the result is to be meaningful and grounded in the system of interest.

Although this theory is one of the dominant models of sensemaking, it has not been extensively tested with a range of sensemaking tasks. The tasks discussed here focused on making sense of structures rather than processes or narratives. Eleven researchers were asked to construct understanding of how a scientific community in a particular domain is organized (e.g., people, relationships, contributions, factors) by exploring the concept of influence in academia. This topic was chosen because, although researchers frequently handle this type of task, it is unlikely that they have explicitly sought this type of information. We conducted a think-aloud study and semistructured interviews with junior and senior researchers from the human-computer interaction (HCI) domain, asking them to identify current leaders and rising stars in both HCI and chemistry. Data were coded and analyzed using the Data/Frame Model to both test and extend the model. Three themes emerged from the analysis: novices and experts' sensemaking activity chains, constructing frames through indicators, and characteristics of structure tasks.

This is to say that being efficient in decoding letters, syllables and whole words and recognizing vocabulary does not ensure natural r automatic comprehension. Fluency seems to be the bridge between the mastery of the mechanics of reading and the dynamics of comprehension. Abundant research exists that explores how to improve reading skills of EFL learners at Saudi universities. However little, if any, of this array of research sought to discern the potential effects of educational technology on the fluency of struggling readers in continuous learning programs. To fill this gap, this study seeks to probe the multi dimensions of the problem and suggest ways to solve it. For this purpose, 24 EFL lecturers from three Saudi universities were selected and interviewed. A suggested computer-assisted collaborative reading model was put forth to be applied in the three universities. Students were diagnosed by their instructors as gaining relatively enough grasp of decoding skills at the multilevels of orthographic knowledge, mono and polysyllabic words, but exhibit slow and inaccurate reading indicating reprehensive symptoms for a fluency problem. The lecturers explained that the disappointment resulting from learners' inability to reach comprehension despite mastering decoding skills influences their attitudes towards reading and language learning, bringing about reading apathy and low self-esteem. The proposed model is designed to enhance reading fluency which is perceived as the underlying problem that makes the reader struggle. It is to be delivered partly individually and partly collaboratively online. Collaboration also is operated via face to face instruction especially in teaching the reading strategy. In doing so, the procedures followed are in line with the blended learning. The findings indicate clearly that the proposed model was successfully used to improve reading fluency through accelerating the different reading subskills for decoding and create positive attitudes toward reading. The results highlight the importance of establishing a level of automaticity that gives rise to the higher skills of comprehension.";"[Omar, Abdulfattah] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Sci & Humanities, Dept English, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Omar, Abdulfattah] Port Said Univ, Fac Arts, Port Fuad, Egypt; [Hussein, Mohamed Saad Mahmoud] Assiut Univ, Fac Educ, Assiut, Egypt; [Alalwi, Fand Shehail] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Dept English, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia";"Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Port Said University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Assiut University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University";"Omar, A (corresponding author), Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Sci & Humanities, Dept English, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia.;Omar, A (corresponding author), Port Said Univ, Fac Arts, Port Fuad, Egypt.";;"Hussein, Mohamed A/O-9461-2018; Omar, Abdulfattah/AAI-4943-2020; hussein, mohamed/GYU-6912-2022";"Omar, Abdulfattah/0000-0002-3618-1750; hussein, mohamed/0000-0002-9688-815X; Alalwi, Fahd/0000-0003-3380-8113; Hussein, Mohamed Saad Mahmoud/0000-0003-2259-7533";;;;;70;0;0;1;4;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

Compiler error messages can help novices to localize and remove errors, but these messages are difficult to understand for students. Previous studies have investigated the compilation error categorization by analyzing compiler error messages, but the categorization cannot cover all kinds of errors, which limits the evaluation of compilation error studies. Therefore, a comprehensive categorization for compilation errors is needed for evaluating the performance of models or tools related to compilation errors. In this study, we first propose a new compilation error categorization, which is based on the smallest unit of the program, tokens. The experiments on 29,573 programs from three datasets show that our proposed compilation error categorization can cover more types of errors and the distribution of the error categorization are significantly different between the datasets. Then, based on our proposed categorization, we develop a neural network model CLACER (CLAssification of Compilation ERrors) for predicting the compilation errors. The results indicate that CLACER can improve the compiler's error localization accuracy and predicts the compilation error effectively. Moreover, based on the proposed categorization, we conduct empirical studies to evaluate the performance of three repairing tools (i.e., DeepFix, RLAssist, and MACER). The comparison results illustrate that DeepFix and RLAssist can fix more errors in the category of delimiter than errors in other categories. Furthermore, MACER performs better than DeepFix and RLAssist because it has a sufficient repairing pattern set for the errors.

Agent-based modelling and simulation is rapidly increasing in its popularity, in part due to the increased appreciation of the paradigm by the non-computer science community, but also due to the increase in the usability, sophistication and number of modelling frameworks that use the approach. The Flexible Largescale Agent-based Modelling Environment (FLAME) is a relatively recent addition to the list. FLAME was designed and developed from the outset to deal with massive simulations, and to ensure that the simulation code is portable across different scales of computing and across different operating systems. In this study, we report our experiences when using FLAME to model the development and propagation of conflict within large multi-partner enterprise system implementations, which acts as an example of a complex dynamical social system. We believe FLAME is an excellent choice for experienced modellers, who will be able to fully harness the capabilities that it has to offer, and also be competent in diagnosing and solving any limitations that are encountered. Conversely, because FLAME requires considerable development of instrumentation tools, along with development of statistical analysis scripts, we believe that it is not suitable for the novice modeller, who may be better suited to using a graphical user interface driven framework until their experience with modelling and competence in programming increases.;[Williams, Richard A.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Management Sci, Lancaster, England;Lancaster University;Williams, RA (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Management Sci, Lancaster, England.;r.williams4@lancaster.ac.uk;;;"Lancaster University Early Career Small Grant; Society for the Advancement of Management Studies, the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills, and the Economic and Social Research Council (SAMS-UKCES-ESRC) [ES/L002612/1]; ESRC [ES/L002612/1] Funding Source: UKRI";"Lancaster University Early Career Small Grant; Society for the Advancement of Management Studies, the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills, and the Economic and Social Research Council (SAMS-UKCES-ESRC); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))";"This work was in part funded by a Lancaster University Early Career Small Grant and a Management and Business Development Fellowship awarded jointly by the Society for the Advancement of Management Studies, the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills, and the Economic and Social Research Council (SAMS-UKCES-ESRC) with Grant No. ES/L002612/1.

We conducted the experiment with 26 graduate (Masters and Ph.D. level) and undergraduate (Bachelor level) students from electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and software engineering programs at the University of Waterloo. The experiment involves a domain model, with UML class diagrams representing the domain abstractions and UML object diagrams representing examples of using these abstractions. The goal is to provide empirical evidence of the effects of suitable examples on model comprehension, compared to having model abstractions only, by having the participants perform model comprehension tasks. Our results show that EDM is superior to having model abstractions only, with an improvement of 39% for diagram completeness, 33% for questions completeness, 71% for efficiency, and a reduction in the number of mistakes by 80%. We provide qualitative results showing that participants receiving model abstractions augmented with examples experienced lower perceived difficulty in performing the comprehension tasks, higher perceived confidence in their tasks' solutions, and asked 90% fewer clarifying domain questions.

However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone. Previous research has shown that one of the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their different representations of knowledge. Experts view the world in terms of deep functional features, while novices view it in terms of shallow perceptual features. Moreover, since the performance of learning algorithms is sensitive to representation, the deep features are also important in achieving effective machine learning. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of deep features, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of algebra as well as synthetic domains. We integrate this algorithm into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, which learns procedural knowledge by observing a tutor solve sample problems, and by getting feedback while actively solving problems on its own. We show that learning deep features reduces the requirements for knowledge engineering. Moreover, we propose an approach that automatically discovers student models using the extended SimStudent. By fitting the discovered model to real student learning curve data, we show that it is a better student model than human-generated models, and demonstrate how the discovered model may be used to improve a tutoring system's instructional strategy.

Anoop";;;MaScQA: investigating materials science knowledge of large language models;DIGITAL DISCOVERY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Information extraction and textual comprehension from materials literature are vital for developing an exhaustive knowledge base that enables accelerated materials discovery. Language models have demonstrated their capability to answer domain-specific questions and retrieve information from knowledge bases. However, there are no benchmark datasets in the materials science domain that can be used to evaluate the understanding of the key concepts by these language models. In this work, we curate a dataset of 650 challenging questions from the materials domain that require the knowledge and skills of a materials science student who has cleared their undergraduate degree. We classify these questions based on their structure and the materials science domain-based subcategories. Further, we evaluate the performance of LLaMA-2-70B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models on solving these questions via zero-shot and chain of thought prompting. It is observed that GPT-4 gives the best performance (similar to 62% accuracy) as compared to other models. Interestingly, in contrast to the general observation, no significant improvement in accuracy is observed with the chain of thought prompting. To evaluate the limitations, we performed an error analysis, which revealed conceptual errors (similar to 72%) as the major contributor compared to computational errors (similar to 28%) towards the reduced performance of the LLMs. We also compared GPT-4 with human performance and observed that GPT-4 is better than an average student and comes close to passing the exam. We also show applications of the best performing model (GPT-4) on composition-extraction from tables of materials science research papers and code writing tasks. While GPT-4 performs poorly on composition extraction, it outperforms all other models on the code writing task. We hope that the dataset, analysis, and applications discussed in this work will promote further research in developing better materials science domain-specific LLMs and strategies for information extraction.

Often these non-programmers use visual languages to specify the robot's and/or machine's control logic. While visual languages are explored as a means to enable novices to program, there is little understanding of what problems novices face when tasked with realistic adaptation programming tasks on the shop floor. In this paper, we report the results of a controlled experiment where domain experts in the injection molding industry inspected and changed realistic programs involving a robot, injection molding machine, and additional external machines. We found that participants were comparably quick to understand the program behavior with a familiar sequential function chart-based language and a Blockly-based language used for the first time. We also observed that these non-programmers had difficulty in multiple aspects independent of language due to the interweaving of physical and software-centric interaction between robot and machine. We conclude that assistance needs to go beyond optimizing available language elements to include suggesting relevant programming elements and their sequence.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

J;Przybylek, A;;;;Przybylek, Adam;;;An empirical study on the impact of AspectJ on software evolvability;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Aspect-oriented programming; AOP; Maintainability; Understandability; Separation of concerns; Controlled experiment";"EVOLUTION; DESIGN; METRICS";Since its inception in 1996, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been believed to reduce the effort required to maintain software systems by replacing cross-cutting code with aspects. However, little convincing empirical evidence exists to support this claim, while several studies suggest that AOP brings new obstacles to maintainability. This paper discusses two controlled experiments conducted to evaluate the impact of AspectJ (the most mature and popular aspect-oriented programming language) versus Java on software evolvability. We consider evolvability as the ease with which a software system can be updated to fulfill new requirements. Since a minor language was compared to the mainstream, the experiments were designed so as to anticipate that the participants were much more experienced in one of the treatments. The first experiment was performed on 35 student subjects who were asked to comprehend either Java or AspectJ implementation of the same system, and perform the corresponding comprehension tasks. Participants of both groups achieved a high rate of correct answers without a statistically significant difference between the groups. Nevertheless, the Java group significantly outperformed the AspectJ group with respect to the average completion time. In the second experiment, 24 student subjects were asked to implement (in a non-invasive way) two extension scenarios to the system that they had already known. Each subject evolved either the Java version using Java or the AspectJ version using AspectJ. We found out that a typical AspectJ programmer needs significantly fewer atomic changes to implement the change scenarios than a typical Java programmer, but we did not observe a significant difference in completion time. The overall result indicates that AspectJ has a different effect on two sub-characteristics of the evolvability: understandability and changeability. While AspectJ decreases the former, it improves one aspect of the latter.;[Przybylek, Adam] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Elect Telecommun & Informat, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland;"Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology";Przybylek, A (corresponding author), Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Elect Telecommun & Informat, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.;adam.przybylek@gmail.com;Przybylek, Adam/AFR-3682-2022;Przybylek, Adam/0000-0002-8231-709X;European Union [UDA-POKL.04.01.01-00-051/10-00];European Union(European Union (EU));The study is cofounded by the European Union from resources of the European Social Fund.

The sparse, short text content and irregular data have brought major challenges to the application of topic models in semantic modeling and topic discovery. To overcome these challenges, researchers have explored topic models and achieved excellent results. However, most of the current topic models are applicable to a specific model task. The majority of current reviews ignore the whole-cycle perspective and framework. It brings great challenges for novices to learn topic models. To deal with the above challenges, we investigate more than a hundred papers on topic models and summarize the research progress on the entire topic model process, including theory, method, datasets, and evaluation indicator. In addition, we also analyzed the statistical data results of the topic model through experiments and introduced its applications in different fields. The paper provides a whole-cycle learning path for novices. It encourages researchers to give more attention to the topic model algorithm and the theory itself without paying extra attention to understanding the relevant datasets, evaluation methods and latest progress.;"[Cheng, Gang; You, Qinliang; Wang, Zhenxue] North China Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Gang] Nanjing Univ High Tech Inst, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Tianbin] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lei] Communt Univ China, State Key Lab Media Convergence & Commun, Beijing 100024, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lei] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Guangxi Key Lab Trusted Software, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jia] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China";"North China Institute Science & Technology; Chengdu University of Technology; Guilin University of Electronic Technology; Beijing University of Technology";"Li, TB (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.;Shi, L (corresponding author), Communt Univ China, State Key Lab Media Convergence & Commun, Beijing 100024, Peoples R China.";"leiky_shi@cuc.edu.cn; ltb@cdut.edu.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42377200]; State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection [SKLGP2021K005]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China [D2022508002]; Suzhou Science and Technology Plan Project [SYG202034]; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software [KX202315]; Innovation Capability Enhancement Plan Project of Hebei Province, China [21567693H]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province); Suzhou Science and Technology Plan Project; Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software; Innovation Capability Enhancement Plan Project of Hebei Province, China";This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42377200), the State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection (No. SKLGP2021K005), the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China (No. D2022508002), Suzhou Science and Technology Plan Project (SYG202034), Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software (No. KX202315), and the Innovation Capability Enhancement Plan Project of Hebei Province, China (21567693H).;;133;0;0;3;4;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1064-1246;1875-8967;;J INTELL FUZZY SYST;J.

However, the practical use of simulation is hampered by the difficulty of interpreting simulation results. This paper demonstrates the learning benefits in conceptual modeling of business requirements when using feedback-enabled simulation. The effects of feedback-enabled simulation on learning outcomes of novice learners were observed by means of experimental empirical studies. Three studies were conducted in the context of two master-level courses from two different study programs spanning two academic years. The findings show a significant improvement in students' conceptual model understanding and validation capabilities when using feedback-enabled simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Initially used exclusively for client-side web development, it has evolved to become one of the most popular programming languages, with developers now using it for both client-side and server-side application development. Similar to applications written in other programming languages, JavaScript applications contain code smells, which are poor design choices that can negatively impact the quality of an application. In this paper, we perform a large-scale study of JavaScript code smells in server-side and client-side applications, with the aim to understand how they impact the fault-proneness of applications, and how they are evolved by the developers of the applications. We detect 12 types of code smells in 1807 releases of 15 popular JavaScript applications (i.e., express, grunt, bower, less.js, request, jquery, vue, ramda, leaflet, hexo, chart, webpack, webtorrent, moment, and riot) and perform survival analysis, comparing the time until a fault occurrence, in files containing code smells and files without code smells. We also examine the introduction and removal of the code smells in the applications using survival models. All our analysis are conducted at the granularity of the line of code. Results show that (1) on average, files without code smells have hazard rates at least 33% lower than files with code smells. (2) Among the studied smells, Variable Re-assign, Assignment In Conditional statements, and Complex Code smells have the highest fault hazard rates. (3) Code smells, and particularly Variable Re-assign, are often introduced in the application when the files containing them are created. Moreover, they tend to remain in the applications for a long period of time; Variable Re-assign is also the most prevalent code smell. Overall, code smells affect negatively the quality of JavaScript applications and developers should consider tracking and removing them early on before the release of applications to the public.";"[Johannes, David; Khomh, Foutse] Polytech Montreal, SWAT Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Antoniol, Giuliano] Polytech Montreal, SOCCER Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada";"Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal";Khomh, F (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, SWAT Lab, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;"david.johannes@polymtl.ca; foutse.khomh@polymtl.ca; giuliano.antoniol@polymtl.ca";;;;;;;53;14;17;0;13;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0963-9314;1573-1367;;SOFTWARE QUAL J;Softw.

However, the experiences of practical software development have empirically confirmed the existences of other causes for code-similarity. Existing practices usually overemphasis the casual relationship between code-similarity and plagiarism, but ignore the importance to make students understand other causes that also contribute to code-similarity. This paper presents an active learning method to involve students and instructors collaboratively in finding causes of code-similarity occurred in programming assignments. The result shows that most causes occurred in programming assignments are positive. Students can learn the different causes of code-similarity with pros and cons during conducting the active learning method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We explored the early experiences of stakeholders using an AI-based imaging software tool Veye Lung Nodules (VLN) aiding the detection, classification, and measurement of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography scans of the chest.Materials and methods We performed semistructured interviews and observations across early adopter deployment sites with clinicians, strategic decision-makers, suppliers, patients with long-term chest conditions, and academics with expertise in the use of diagnostic AI in radiology settings. We coded the data using the Technology, People, Organizations, and Macroenvironmental factors framework.Results We conducted 39 interviews. Clinicians reported VLN to be easy to use with little disruption to the workflow. There were differences in patterns of use between experts and novice users with experts critically evaluating system recommendations and actively compensating for system limitations to achieve more reliable performance. Patients also viewed the tool positively. There were contextual variations in tool performance and use between different hospital sites and different use cases. Implementation challenges included integration with existing information systems, data protection, and perceived issues surrounding wider and sustained adoption, including procurement costs.Discussion Tool performance was variable, affected by integration into workflows and divisions of labor and knowledge, as well as technical configuration and infrastructure.Conclusion The socio-organizational factors affecting performance of diagnostic AI are under-researched and require attention and further research.;"[Faric, Nusa; Hinder, Sue; Bernabeu, Miguel O.; Cresswell, Kathrin] Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst, Old Med Sch,Teviot Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Scotland; [Williams, Robin] Univ Edinburgh, Inst Study Sci Technol & Innovat, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Ramaesh, Rishi] Royal Infirm Hosp, Dept Radiol, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Bernabeu, Miguel O.] Univ Edinburgh, Bayes Ctr, Edinburgh, Scotland; [van Beek, Edwin] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Cardiovasc Sci, Edinburgh Imaging & Neurosci, Edinburgh, Scotland";"University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh";Cresswell, K (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst, Old Med Sch,Teviot Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Scotland.;Kathrin.Cresswell@ed.ac.uk;"Bernabeu, Miguel O/K-3288-2012; Hinder, Sue/KHX-7786-2024";Faric, Nusa/0000-0002-2826-1478;The authors would like to thank the people participating in this work.

Existing code search techniques typically focus on finding code snippets for a single given query, which means that developers need to perform a separate search for each desired functionality. In this paper, we propose FACER (F eature-driven A PI usage-based C ode E xamples R ecommender), a technique that avoids repeated searches through opportunistic reuse. Specifically, given the selected code snippet that matches the initial search query, FACER finds and suggests related code snippets that represent features that the developer may want to implement next. FACER first constructs a code fact repository by parsing the source code of open-source Java projects to obtain methods' textual information, call graphs, and Application Programming Interface (API) usages. It then detects unique features by clustering methods based on similar API usages, where each cluster represents a feature or functionality. Finally, it detects frequently co-occurring features across projects using frequent pattern mining and recommends related methods from the mined patterns. To evaluate FACER, we run it on 120 Java Android apps from GitHub. We first manually validate that the detected method clusters represent methods with similar functionality. We then perform an automated evaluation to determine the best parameters (e.g., similarity threshold) for FACER. We recruit 10 professional developers along with 39 experienced students to judge FACER's recommendation of related methods. Our results show that, on average, FACER's recommendations are 80% precise. We also survey a total of 20 professional Android and Java developers to understand their code search and reuse experiences, and also to obtain their feedback on the usability and usefulness of FACER. The survey results show that 95% of our surveyed professional developers find the idea of related method recommendations useful during code reuse.;"[Abid, Shamsa; Shamail, Shafay] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Lahore, Pakistan; [Basit, Hamid Abdul] Prince Sultan Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Nadi, Sarah] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada";"Lahore University of Management Sciences; Prince Sultan University; University of Alberta";Abid, S (corresponding author), Lahore Univ Management Sci, Lahore, Pakistan.;"shamsa.abid@lums.edu.pk; sshamail@lums.edu.pk; hbasit@psu.edu.sa; nadi@ualberta.ca";Basit, Hamid/AAG-3806-2020;"Basit, Hamid/0000-0002-1684-4262; Shamail, Shafay/0000-0003-4153-7827";"Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS); Ignite National Technology Fund Pakistan [SRG-257]; Prince Sultan University; Canada Research Chairs Program";"Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS); Ignite National Technology Fund Pakistan; Prince Sultan University; Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs)";The authors are thankful to the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Ignite National Technology Fund Pakistan (SRG-257), and Prince Sultan University for funding our research.

We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9-12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors.

Students depend on current research to understand the definition, function, and culture of CT and to consider how it can improve their analytical and critical skills. A contextualized definition of the CT method is proposed as a cognitive process executed by humans to solve problems using computational concepts. This method improves CT in terms of decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithm design, abstraction, data representation, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and generalization of patterns, simulation and evaluation. The research carried out is an experimental design with a pretest and a posttest, with a control group and an experimental group to which the intervention was applied, both with 18 students. This article describes a study developing and incorporating CT modules and assessing their effect on the comprehension of CT principles by preservation teachers as well as their computing attitude. The results show that the implementation of analytical thought in education courses will successfully affect the comprehension of CT principles by preservice students.;"[del Rey, Yailem Arencibia Rodriguez; Cambinda, Isabel Nissandra Cawanga; Avello-Martinez, Raidell] Univ Cienfuegos, Dept Informat, Carretera Rodas,Km 4, Cienfuegos 55200, Cuba; [Deco, Claudia; Bender, Cristina] Pontificia Univ Catolica Argentina, Fac Quim & Ingn, Rosario, Argentina; [Villalba-Condori, Klinge Orlando] Univ Nacl San Agustin, Fac Ciencias Educ, Arequipa, Peru";"Universidad de Cienfuegos; Pontificia Universidad Catolica Argentina; Universidad Nacional de San Agustin de Arequipa";del Rey, YAR (corresponding author), Univ Cienfuegos, Dept Informat, Carretera Rodas,Km 4, Cienfuegos 55200, Cuba.;yarencibia@ucf.edu.cu;"CONDORI, KLINGE ORLANDO VILLALBA/U-1040-2017; Martínez, Raidell Avello/I-4852-2013";"CONDORI, KLINGE ORLANDO VILLALBA/0000-0002-8621-7942; Martínez, Raidell Avello/0000-0001-7200-632X; Deco, Claudia/0000-0002-7146-1571; Bender, Cristina/0000-0001-6961-1983";;;;;16;17;17;4;59;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

This longitudinal study was conducted to investigate the effect of learning environments-blended and online, alone and with graded-reading websites/applications-on the reading comprehension of Saudi undergraduates majoring in English during COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, 130 participants were selected (control: male [N = 21], female [N = 54]; or experimental: male [N = 21], female [N = 34]). Although the four gender-based groups were exposed to the same learning environments-first blended and later online, which were either partially or dependent on technology-only the male and female experimental groups were required to use graded-reading websites/applications for approximately 10 months during the COVID-19 school lockdowns. All participants took four tests (pretest, posttest 1, posttest 2, and delayed posttest). Using the SPSS program, the results indicated that the learning environments alone had a limited positive effect on the control groups' reading comprehension in the short term, which either decreased significantly (male control group) or remained unchanged (female control group) in the long term. There were significant differences between all control groups and experimental groups across all tests (p < 0.000). However, the experimental male group outperformed their male counterpart across all posttests except for the second posttest: experimental male group mean was 15.43 whereas it was 16.19 for the control male group. However, combining learning environments and graded-reading websites/applications yielded gradual positive effects on the reading comprehension of the experimental groups in the short term, which continued into the long term for the male experimental group. The experimental groups outperformed the control groups on at least two out of three posttests. The study concluded that the effect of technology on the reading comprehension of Saudi male and female undergraduates is bounded by the type of specialized technology (i.e., reading websites/applications) and the applied learning environments (i.e., blended and online). Additionally, the study indicated that there is a need to investigate other important factors related to technology used in Saudi institutes, as well as its effects on students' learning processes in ongoing changes in the education sector in Saudi Arabia.";"[Alghizzi, Talal Musaed] Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Languages & Translat, Dept English Language & Literature, Riyadh 11432, Saudi Arabia; [Elyas, Tariq] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Foreign Languages & Literature, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia";"Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); King Abdulaziz University";Alghizzi, TM (corresponding author), Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ, Coll Languages & Translat, Dept English Language & Literature, Riyadh 11432, Saudi Arabia.;"tmalghizzi@imanau.edu.sa; telyas@kau.edu.sa";"Elyas, Tariq/J-9790-2015; Alghizzi, Talal Musaed/AAW-8649-2021";"Elyas, Tariq/0000-0002-2898-7391; Alghizzi, Talal Musaed/0000-0002-1088-9216";;;;;45;2;2;1;27;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;JUN;2022;11;11;;;;;;;1751;10.3390/electronics11111751;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11111751;;;22;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";1Z8PS;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000809079800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Code smell is one of the factors which reduce the quality of source code. Several previous studies investigated the prevalence of code smell in DL software systems to evaluate the quality of DL source code. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the awareness of individual DL developers in code smell. To more deeply understand the code smell risk in DL software development, it is needed to investigate the code smell awareness of DL developers. In this paper, we present an empirical study on code smell practices of DL developers. Specifically, we performed a quantitative analysis on code smell introduction and removal practices of DL developers. We collected a dataset of code smell introduction and removal history of DL developers from several open source DL software GitHub repositories. We then quantitatively analyzed the collected dataset. As a result of the quantitative analysis, we observed the following three findings on code smell introduction and removal practices of DL developers. First, DL developers tend to perform code smell introduction practice more than code smell removal practice. Second, DL developers have slightly broader code smell introduction scope than code smell removal scope. Third, regular and irregular DL developers have less difference in both code smell introduction and removal practices. The results indicate that DL developers have very poor awareness on code smell risk. Our findings suggest that DL software development project managers should provide a helpful guideline that makes DL developers actively participate code smell removal tasks.;"[Kim, Jungil] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Ctr Selforganizing Software Platform, Daegu 41566, South Korea; [Lee, Eunjoo] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Daegu 41566, South Korea";"Kyungpook National University (KNU); Kyungpook National University (KNU)";Lee, E (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Daegu 41566, South Korea.;"2009307043@knu.ac.kr; ejlee@knu.ac.kr";;;Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025109];Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea);This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (No. NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025109).;;39;0;0;3;6;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0218-1940;1793-6403;;INT J SOFTW ENG KNOW;Int.

Understanding OOP concepts can be difficult for novice programmers, and often leads to the development of misconceptions. This is exacerbated when the discipline requires students to learn a technical low-level language such as C++, as is the case in many engineering disciplines. We propose a block-based programming language extension, Blockly-OOP, to help students learn core OOP concepts without the technical complexities associated with traditional textual languages. The Blockly-OOP Learning Environment was developed by integrating Blockly-OOP with learning activities that guide students through programming exercises that target popular OOP misconceptions. An evaluation (n = 238) in a second-year programming course (CS2) showed that a block-based programming language helps students improve their understanding of object-oriented concepts, warranting further research in this area.;"[Allen, Oliver; Downs, Xavier; Varoy, Elliot; Luxton-Reilly, Andrew; Giacaman, Nasser] Univ Auckland, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Sch Comp Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand";University of Auckland;Giacaman, N (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Sch Comp Sci, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.;"oall605@aucklanduni.ac.nz; xdow620@aucklanduni.ac.nz; evar872@aucklanduni.ac.nz; a.luxton-reilly@auckland.ac.nz; n.giacaman@auckland.ac.nz";Luxton-Reilly, Andrew/ABC-5342-2021;Luxton-Reilly, Andrew/0000-0001-8269-2909;Ako Aotearoa RHPF in developing Blockly-OOP;Ako Aotearoa RHPF in developing Blockly-OOP;This work was supported by Ako Aotearoa RHPF in developing Blockly-OOP.;;83;2;2;9;30;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

With the ever increasing complexity of software systems, software modeling is integral to software development. Software models facilitate and automate many activities during development, such as code and test case generation. However, a core goal of software modeling is to communicate and collaborate. Software models are presented to team members on many mediums and two of the most common mediums are paper and computer screens. Reading from paper or screen is ostensibly considered to have the same effect on model comprehension. However, the literature on text reading has indicated that the reading experiences can be very different which in turn effects various metrics related to reader performance. This paper reports on an experiment that was conducted to investigate the effect of reading software models on paper in comparison with reading them on a computer screen with respect to cognitive effectiveness. Cognitive effectiveness here refers to the ease by which a model reader can read a model. The experiment used a total of 74 software engineering students as subjects. The experiment results provide strong evidence that displaying diagrams on a screen allows subjects to read them quicker. There is also evidence that indicates that on screen viewing induces fewer reading errors.;[El-Attar, Mohamed] Zayed Univ, Coll Technol Innovat, POB 144534, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates;Zayed University;El-Attar, M (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Coll Technol Innovat, POB 144534, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.;Mohamed.El-Attar@zu.ac.ae;El-Attar, Mohamed/C-4329-2015;El-Attar, Mohamed/0000-0002-6709-8212;;;;;52;0;0;1;6;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1619-1366;1619-1374;;SOFTW SYST MODEL;Softw.

Several source code measures may be used to identify difficult-to-understand code, including well-known ones such as Lines of Code and McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity, and novel ones, such as Cognitive Complexity.ObjectiveWe investigate whether and to what extent source code measures, individually or together, are correlated with code understandability.MethodWe carried out an empirical study with students who were asked to carry out realistic maintenance tasks on methods from real-life Open Source Software projects. We collected several data items, including the time needed to correctly complete the maintenance tasks, which we used to quantify method understandability. We investigated the presence of correlations between the collected code measures and code understandability by using several Machine Learning techniques.ResultsWe obtained models of code understandability using one or two code measures. However, the obtained models are not very accurate, the average prediction error being around 30%.ConclusionsBased on our empirical study, it does not appear possible to build an understandability model based on structural code measures alone. Specifically, even the newly introduced Cognitive Complexity measure does not seem able to fulfill the promise of providing substantial improvements over existing measures, at least as far as code understandability prediction is concerned. It seems that, to obtain models of code understandability of acceptable accuracy, process measures should be used, possibly together with new source code measures that are better related to code understandability.;"[Lavazza, Luigi; Morasca, Sandro; Gatto, Marco] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Sci Teor & Applicate, Varese, Italy";University of Insubria;Lavazza, L (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Sci Teor & Applicate, Varese, Italy.;"luigi.lavazza@uninsubria.it; sandro.morasca@uninsubria.it; marcogatto.1997@hotmail.it";;Morasca, Sandro/0000-0003-4598-7024;The authors would like to thank the students that participated in the empirical study, the professionals that participated in the interviews, and Anatoliy Roshka and Gabriele Rotoloni, who developed the tool we used to measure Cognitive Complexity.;The authors would like to thank the students that participated in the empirical study, the professionals that participated in the interviews, and Anatoliy Roshka and Gabriele Rotoloni, who developed the tool we used to measure Cognitive Complexity.;The authors would like to thank the students that participated in the empirical study, the professionals that participated in the interviews, and Anatoliy Roshka and Gabriele Rotoloni, who developed the tool we used to measure Cognitive Complexity.;;51;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

This paper investigates how websites are used when writing code and programmers' perceptions of the potential impact of this on their behaviour and the quality of the resulting software. We interviewed 18 programmers (13 students enrolled in undergraduate computer science courses, and 5 experienced professionals), and analysed the data thematically. The findings were used to develop a survey, which was distributed to 276 programmers (251 students, 25 experienced professionals). The results indicate that use of websites, especially Stack Overflow, is viewed as an essential part of programming by both students completing coursework and professionals developing code in industry. We also found that developers have experience of encountering a diverse set of problematic code snippets online, that copying code from websites without checking its quality or understanding how it worked is common, and that using online resources in this way had a potentially counter-productive effect on learning. Based on these findings, we make a number of recommendations, including better consideration of online code reuse in taught programmes, co-development and code-reuse practices in professional settings, and software licensing training for professional developers.

The goal is to allow new students and researchers to quickly get started in the research area and to skip many of the initial steps, often consuming unnecessarily long time from the scientific advancement of the field. This is achieved by providing a step-by-step guide to the components necessary to understand and implement the theory, as well as extending the supplied MATLAB code. The continuous design representation used and how it is connected to the Brinkman penalty approach, for simulating an immersed solid in a fluid domain, are illustrated. The different interpretations of the Brinkman penalty term and how to chose the penalty parameters are explained. The accuracy of the Brinkman penalty approach is analysed through parametric simulations of a reference geometry. The chosen finite element formulation and the solution method are explained. The minimum dissipated energy optimisation problem is defined and how to solve it using an optimality criteria solver and a continuation scheme is discussed. The included MATLAB implementation is documented, with details on the mesh, pre-processing, optimisation and post-processing. The code has two benchmark examples implemented and the application of the code to these is reviewed. Subsequently, several modifications to the code for more complicated examples are presented through provided code modifications and explanations. Lastly, the computational performance of the code is examined through studies of the computational time and memory usage, along with recommendations to decrease computational time through approximations.;[Alexandersen, Joe] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Mech & Elect Engn, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark;University of Southern Denmark;Alexandersen, J (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Mech & Elect Engn, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.;joal@sdu.dk;Alexandersen, Joe/H-8638-2013;Alexandersen, Joe/0000-0001-7872-6272;;;;;36;9;9;8;34;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1615-147X;1615-1488;;STRUCT MULTIDISCIP O;Struct.

Code splitting is a hardening technique that moves selected chunks of code from client to server. Although widely adopted, the effective benefits of code splitting are not fully understood and thoroughly assessed. Objective The objective of this work is to compare non protected code vs. code splitting protected code, considering two levels of the chunk size parameter, in order to assess the effectiveness of the protection - in terms of both attack time and success rate - and to understand the attack strategy and process used to overcome the protection. Method We conducted an experiment with master students performing attack tasks on a small application hardened with different levels of protection. Students carried out their task working at the source code level. Results We observed a statistically significant effect of code splitting on the attack success rate that, on the average, was reduced from 89% with unprotected clear code to 52% with the most effective protection. The protection variant that moved some small-sized code chunks turned out to be more effective than the alternative moving fewer but larger chunks. Different strategies were identified yielding different success rates. Moreover we discovered that successful attacks exhibited different process w.r.t. failed ones. Conclusions We found empirical evidence of the effect of code splitting, assessed the relative magnitude, and evaluated the influence of the chunk size parameter.

This development increasingly calls for citizens to have a basic understanding of programming and computational thinking (PCT). Accordingly, countries worldwide are implementing several approaches to integrate critical elements of PCT into K-9 education. However, these efforts are confronted by difficulties that the PCT concepts are for students to grasp from purely theoretical perspectives. Recent literature indicates that the playful nature is particularly important when novices from both both early and higher education are to learn AI. These playful activities are characterised by setting a scene where PCT concepts such as algorithms, data processing, and simulations are meant to draw on to understand better how AI is integrated into our everyday digital life. This discussion paper analyses playful PCT resources developed around the game rock-paper-scissors developed in the UK and Denmark. Resources from these countries are interesting starting points since both have been or are in the process of integrating PCT as part of the K-9 curriculum. The central discussion raised by the paper, is the nature of the integration between mathematics and PCT in these tasks. These resources provide opportunities for discussion of how we may better integrate PCT and mathematics from the perspective of both subjects to build a solid foundation for a critical understanding of AI interactions in future generations.;"[Tamborg, Andreas Lindenskov] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Digital Educ, Univ 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Elicer, Raimundo] Aarhus Univ, Danish Sch Educ, Tuborgvej 164, DK-2400 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Spikol, Daniel] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Digital Educ, Univ Pk 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Spikol, Daniel] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Univ 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark";"University of Copenhagen; Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen";"Spikol, D (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Digital Educ, Univ Pk 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.;Spikol, D (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Univ 1, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.";"andreas_tamborg@ind.ku.dk; raimundo@edu.au.dk; ds@di.ku.dk";"Elicer, Raimundo/ITT-4565-2023; Spikol, Daniel/G-2189-2014";"Elicer, Raimundo/0000-0002-9772-6646; Tamborg, Andreas Lindenskov/0000-0001-7578-7838; Spikol, Daniel/0000-0001-9454-0793";Novo Nordisk Foundation [NNF19OC0058651];Novo Nordisk Foundation(Novo Nordisk FoundationNovocure Limited);The research is funded by Novo Nordisk Foundation Grant NNF19OC0058651.;;38;4;4;14;79;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0933-1875;1610-1987;;KUNSTL INTELL;Kunstl.

This study explores the factors that attract the developers and programmers to utilize LCDP and discusses some of the problems and challenges that prevent other programmers and developers from using it. An online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia among 49 respondents of professional developers from different departments of Information Technology in several kinds of businesses as well as students from the Computing and Information Technology faculties to understand the developers' motivations to adopt low-code development platforms. A total of 19 respondents were using LCDP, while the other 30 were not. The paper also highlights the reasons why some developers are not interested in moving toward low-code and commit to the traditional programming approach. The results of this study explain the factors and advantages that prompt developers to use LCDP and identifies the concerns that prevent them from using it. Reducing development time is considered as an advantage by the majority of the sample that used LCDP. Additionally, the Minimum coding needed reduces the development time and make the application development much easier. On the other hand, some of the reasons for not using LCDP by the developers were the low level of scalability in these platforms, and a lack of knowledge about these platforms and how to deal with them.;"[Alsaadi, Hana A.; Radain, Dhefaf T.; Alzahrani, Maysoon M.; Alshammari, Wahj F.; Alahmadi, Dimah; Fakieh, Bahjat] King Abdulaziz Univ, Informat Syst Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia";King Abdulaziz University;Fakieh, B (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Informat Syst Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.;"hralsaadi@stu.kau.edu.sa; dradain@kau.edu.sa; mahmedalzahrani0006@stu.kau.edu.sa; wsalehalshamary@stu.kau.edu.sa; dalahmadi@kau.edu.sa; BFakieh@kau.edu.sa";Fakieh, Bahjat/H-3018-2018;Fakieh, Bahjat/0000-0003-2793-1238;;;;;30;5;7;6;67;INST NATL CERCETARE-DEZVOLTARE INFORMATICA-ICI;BUCHAREST;8-10 MARESAL A AVERESCU AV, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 011455, ROMANIA;1220-1758;1841-4303;;ROM J INF TECH AUT C;Rom.

However, learning embedded programming is still hard, requiring an understanding of coding, electronics, and how both sides interact. To investigate the opportunities of using a different programming paradigm than the imperative approach to learning embedded coding, we developed Flowboard. Students code in a visual iPad editor using flow-based programming, which is conceptually closer to circuit diagrams than imperative code. Two breadboards with I/O pins mirrored on the iPad connect electronics and program graph more seamlessly than existing IDEs. Program changes take effect immediately. This liveness reflects circuit behavior better than edit-compile-run loops. A first study confirmed that students can solve basic embedded programming tasks with Flowboard while highlighting important differences to a typical imperative IDE, Ardublock.

These benefits enable new types of applications that can bring competitive advantage to several business segments. Nonetheless, the pressure of time-to-market combined with relatively immature development technologies (e.g., the Solidity programming language), lack of high-quality training resources, and an unclear roadmap for Ethereum creates a context that favors the introduction of technical debt (e.g., code hacks, workarounds, and suboptimal implementations) into application code. In this paper, we study self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in smart contracts. SATD refers to technical debt that is explicitly acknowledged in the source code by developers via code comments. We extract 726 k real-world contracts from Ethereum and apply both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to (i) determine SATD prevalence, (ii) understand the relationship between code cloning and SATD prevalence, and (iii) uncover the different categories of SATD. Our findings reveal that, while SATD is not a widespread phenomenon (1.5% of real-world contracts contain SATD), SATD does occur in extremely relevant contracts (e.g., multi-million contracts). We also observed a strong connection between SATD prevalence and code cloning activities, leading us to conclude that the former cannot be reliably studied without taking the latter into consideration. Finally, we produced a taxonomy for SATD that consists of 6 major and 26 minor categories. We note that several minor categories are bound to the domain of blockchain and smart contracts, including gas-inefficient implementations and Solidity-induced workarounds. Based on our results, we derive a set of practical recommendations for contract developers and introduce open research questions to guide future research on the topic.;"[Ebrahimi, Amir Mohammad; Oliva, Gustavo A.; Hassan, Ahmed E.] Queens Univ, Sch Comp, Software Anal & Intelligence Lab SAIL, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada";Queens University - Canada;Ebrahimi, AM (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sch Comp, Software Anal & Intelligence Lab SAIL, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.;"amir.ebrahimi@queensu.ca; golivax@gmail.com; ahmed@cs.queensu.ca";;"Hassan, Ahmed E./0000-0001-7749-5513; Ebrahimi, AmirMohammad/0000-0003-0706-9820";Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC);Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC));This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).;;70;1;1;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;0098-5589;1939-3520;;IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG;IEEE Trans.

One reason might be that these pupils are unable to comprehend programming basics, notably the usage of selective and repeated structures (loops), which are too complex and abstract for them to comprehend.OBJECTIVES: Programming structured applications requires understanding the relationship between variable-operators and declarations, so a more intuitive and practical visualization technique is needed. In view of this, this article presents an augmented reality (AR) learning system using a DF-RA mobile application that offers visual representation and interactivity to help college students in entry-level computer science-related majors learn to program structured applications using dynamic and interactive flowcharts.METHODS: In order to examine the influences of said Augmented Reality-enhanced system on student learning, an experiment will be carried out within the group with 34 university students. All students used both an augmented reality enhanced version and a conventional paper version (classic methodology with paper flowcharts).RESULTS: The expected results is that the augmented reality version through the DF-RA mobile application made students have a better learning efficiency than the traditional paper system. In addition, the system enhanced with Augmented Reality also made students have improved perceptions in terms of system usability, flow experience, and usage perception.CONCLUSION: Experimental findings were analyzed to demonstrate that the augmented reality learning system increases students' motivation to study structured programming fundamentals and their practical competence.;"[Oyarvide, Wellington Remigio Villota; Salvatierra, Shirley Betty Reyes] Univ Catolica Santiago Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Saltos, Guillermo Del Campo] Univ Estatal Milagro, Milagro, Ecuador";Universidad Estatal de Milagro;Oyarvide, WRV (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santiago Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador.;wellington.villota@cu.ucsg.edu.ec;;;;;;;53;0;0;3;10;INST COMPUTER SCIENCES, SOCIAL INFORMATICS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENG-ICST;GHENT;BEGIJNHOFLAAN 93, GHENT, 90000, BELGIUM;2032-9407;;;EAI ENDORSED TRANS S;EAI Endorsed Trans.

The current software production has been largely dependent on manual code development. Despite the slow development process, the errors introduced by the programmers contribute to a substantial portion of defects in the final software product. Model-driven engineering (MDE), despite having many advantages, is often overlooked by programmers due to lack of proper understanding and training in the matter. This paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of MDE and looks at research results showing the adoption rates of design models. It analyzes different tools used for automated code generation and displays the reasons that led to technical decisions such as the programming language or design model used. In light of the findings, an educational tool, namely Lorini, was developed to provide automated code generation from the design models. The implemented tool consists of a plug-in for the Astah framework aimed at teaching Java programming to students through UML diagrams. It features instantaneous code generation from three types of UML diagrams, code-diagram matching, a feedback panel for error displays and on-the-fly compilation and execution of the resulting program. We also explore the possibility of generating assertion constraints from the design model and use them to verify the implementation. Evaluation of the tool indicated it to be successful with unique educational features and intuitive to use.;"[Eckert, Candice; Cham, Brian; Li, Pengyi] Univ Auckland, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Sun, Jing; Dobbie, Gillian] Univ Auckland, Dept Comp Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand";"University of Auckland; University of Auckland";Sun, J (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Comp Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.;"ceck002@aucklanduni.ac.nz; bcha899@aucklanduni.ac.nz; pli552@aucklanduni.ac.nz; jing@cs.auckland.ac.nz; gill@cs.auckland.ac.nz";Pengyi, Li/HOI-0743-2023;Pengyi, Li/0000-0003-0092-2710;;;;;24;1;1;0;2;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0218-1940;1793-6403;;INT J SOFTW ENG KNOW;Int.

Narrative analysis is a useful method for experts to understand narratives. However, it does not produce any clear or explicit layouts. This is not easy for a new learner without prior knowledge to glean the right messages from narratives within a short time. In this paper, a narrative knowledge extraction and representation system (NKERS) is presented to extract and represent narrative knowledge in an effective manner. The NKERS is composed of a narrative knowledge element extraction algorithm, a narrative knowledge representation method and a narrative knowledge database. A prototype system has been built and trial implemented in the construction industry. The results show that the domain experts agree that the narrative maps generated by the NKERS can effectively represent narrative elements and flows. Three-quarters of respondents expressed that they will use the produced narrative maps in their training courses to facilitate students' learning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To do so, students are commonly asked to self-rate their experience, as self-rated experience has been shown to be a good predictor for performance in programming tasks. Another experience-related measurement is participants' confidence (i.e., how confident is the person that their given answer is correct). Hence, self-rated experience and confidence are used as selector or control variables throughout empirical software engineering research and software engineering education. In this paper, we analyze data from several student experiments conducted in the past years to investigate whether self-rated experience and confidence are also good predictors for students' performance in model comprehension tasks. Our results show that while students can somewhat assess the correctness of a particular answer to one concrete question regarding a conceptual model (i.e., their confidence), their overall self-rated experience does not correlate with their actual performance. Hence, the use of the commonly used measurement of self-rated experience as a selector or control variable must be considered unreliable for model comprehension tasks.;"[Daun, Marian; Brings, Jennifer; Obe, Patricia Aluko; Stenkova, Viktoria] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany";University of Duisburg Essen;Daun, M (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.;"marian.daun@paluno.uni-due.de; jennifer.brings@paluno.uni-due.de; patricia.aluko-obe@paluno.uni-due.de; viktoria.stenkova@paluno.uni-due.de";;;German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) [01IS16043V];German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF));This work was partially funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) under grant no. 01IS16043V.

To facilitate integration of technology and to actively engage students, quick response codes were included in a medical surgical lecture. Quick response codes are two-dimensional square patterns that enable the coding or storage of more than 7000 characters that can be accessed via a quick response code scanning application. The aim of this quasi-experimental study was to explore quick response code use in a lecture and measure students' satisfaction (met expectations, increased interest, helped understand, and provided practice and prompt feedback) and engagement (liked most, liked least, wanted changed, and kept involved), assessed using an investigator-developed instrument. Although there was no statistically significant correlation of quick response use to examination scores, satisfaction scores were high, and there was a small yet positive association between how students perceived their learning with quick response codes and overall examination scores. Furthermore, on open-ended survey questions, students responded that they were satisfied with the use of quick response codes, appreciated the immediate feedback, and planned to use them in the clinical setting. Quick response codes offer a way to integrate technology into the classroom to provide students with instant positive feedback.;"[Zurmehly, Joyce] Ohio State Univ, Coll Nursing, 318 Newton Hall,1585 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Adams, Kellie] Ohio Univ, Chillicothe, OH USA";"University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University";Zurmehly, J (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Nursing, 318 Newton Hall,1585 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;zurmehly.8@ohio.edu;Zurmehly, Joyce/AAR-5757-2020;;;;;;34;8;9;0;14;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1538-2931;1538-9774;;CIN-COMPUT INFORM NU;CIN-Comput.

However, several studies have also noted the skepticism of testers regarding the comprehension of generated test suites when compared to manually designed ones. This fact suggests that involving testers in the test generation process could be helpful to increase their acceptance of automatically-produced test suites. In this paper, we propose incorporating interactive readability assessments made by a tester into EvoSuite, a widely-known evolutionary test generation tool. Our approach, InterEvo-TR, interacts with the tester at different moments during the search and shows different test cases covering the same coverage target for their subjective evaluation. The design of such an interactive approach involves a schedule of interaction, a method to diversify the selected targets, a plan to save and handle the readability values, and some mechanisms to customize the level of engagement in the revision, among other aspects. To analyze the potential and practicability of our proposal, we conduct a controlled experiment in which 39 participants, including academics, professional developers, and student collaborators, interact with InterEvo-TR. Our results show that the strategy to select and present intermediate results is effective for the purpose of readability assessment. Furthermore, the participants' actions and responses to a questionnaire allowed us to analyze the aspects influencing test code readability and the benefits and limitations of an interactive approach in the context of test case generation, paving the way for future developments based on interactivity.;"[Delgado-Perez, Pedro; Valle-Gomez, Kevin J.] Univ Cadiz, Cadiz 11003, Spain; [Ramirez, Aurora; Romero, Jose Raul] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba 14071, Spain";"Universidad de Cadiz; Universidad de Cordoba";Delgado-Pérez, P (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Cadiz 11003, Spain.;"pedro.delgado@uca.es; aramirez@uco.es; kevin.valle@uca.es; inmaculada.medina@uca.es; jrromero@uco.es";"Delgado-Pérez, Pedro/N-4289-2018; Medina-Bulo, Inmaculada/L-5523-2014; Romero, Jose Raul/I-5658-2015; Ramirez, Aurora/A-3635-2019; Valle-Gomez, Kevin J./D-8998-2018";"Delgado-Pérez, Pedro/0000-0003-1568-9288; Medina-Bulo, Inmaculada/0000-0002-7543-2671; Romero, Jose Raul/0000-0002-4550-6385; Ramirez, Aurora/0000-0002-1916-6559; Valle-Gomez, Kevin J./0000-0001-6066-9441";"European Commission (FEDER); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation - MICIN/AEI [PID2021-122215NB-C33, RTI2018-093608-BC33, RED2018-102472-T, PID2020-115832GB-I00]; Andalusian Regional Government [DOC_00944]";"European Commission (FEDER)(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation - MICIN/AEI; Andalusian Regional Government";This work was supported in part by the European Commission (FEDER), in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under Grants PID2021-122215NB-C33, RTI2018-093608-BC33, RED2018-102472-T, and PID2020-115832GB-I00 funded by MICIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, and in part by the Andalusian Regional Government postdoctoral under Grant DOC_00944.;;36;3;3;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;0098-5589;1939-3520;;IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG;IEEE Trans.

It employs disturbing, excite, and eye and head movement patterns to infer important information about a student's mood in an e-learning environment. Researchers from numerous disciplines have been focusing on emotion detection technologies to better understand user engagement, efficacy, and utility of systems that have been established or are being deployed. The goal of this study is to see if students' facial expressions can be used by lecturers to understand students' comprehension levels in a virtual classroom, as well as to determine the influence of facial expressions during lectures and the degree of comprehension displayed by these emotions. The objective is to determine which facial physical behaviours are associated with emotional states and then to determine how these emotional states are related to student understanding. The major purpose of this work is to plan and develop a new deep learning-oriented facial expression recognition (FER) of online learners from real-time videos. For the frames of online learners from real-time videos, the Viola-Jones Face detection algorithm is employed for face detection. Further, the pattern extraction is performed by the optimized local directional Texture Pattern (LDTP) using the hybrid Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA), and Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHOA) referred as Coyote-Deer Hunting Optimization (C-DHO). These pattern images are inputted to the convolutional neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. Furthermore, the heuristically modified recurrent neural network (HM-RNN) using the same C-DHO is used for the expression recognition. The experimental research reveals that the suggested method aids in the identification of emotions as well as the classification of student participation and interest in the topic, all of which are displayed as feedback to the teacher in terms of improving the learner experience.;"[Jagadeesh, M.; Baranidharan, B.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India";SRM Institute of Science & Technology Chennai;Jagadeesh, M (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Technol, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.;"jm6724@srmist.edu.in; baranidb@srmist.edu.in";"B, Baranidharan/ABE-8614-2021; Jagadeesh, Mohan/IXN-8186-2023";"B, Baranidharan/0000-0003-0274-9341; Jagadeesh, Mohan/0000-0002-0419-1380";;;;;43;6;6;5;44;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0942-4962;1432-1882;;MULTIMEDIA SYST;Multimedia Syst.;DEC;2022;28;6;;;;;2285;2305;;10.1007/s00530-022-00957-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00530-022-00957-z;;JUN 2022;21;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;6L1RU;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000809306100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, scant empirical evidence identifies why students join such programs. In this paper, we study the well-established Google Summer of Code (GSoC), which is a 3-month OSS engagement program that offers stipends and mentorship to students willing to contribute to OSS projects. We combined a survey (of students and mentors) and interviews (of students) to understand what motivates students to enter GSoC. Our results show that students enter GSoC for an enriching experience, and not necessarily to become frequent contributors. Our data suggest that, while stipends are an important motivator, students participate for work experience and the ability to enhance their resumes. We also discuss practical implications for students, mentors, OSS projects, and Summer of Code programs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, we explore how to leverage Learn-OCaml's automated grading infrastructure to make it easy to write more expressive graders that give students feedback on properties of their code beyond simple input/output correctness, in order to effectively teach elements of functional programming style. In particular, we describe our extensions to the Learn-OCand platform that evaluate students on test quality and code style.

Programming languages provide a variety of dynamic memory management methods to support programmers in preventing the introduction of defects that cause memory leaks. However, it is not yet possible to completely free programmers from the work of memory management. Indeed, runtime leak detection is time consuming and usually done after the fact, while manual code inspection requires rich developer experience. Understanding the common patterns of memory leaks can help developers be mindful of leaks or avoid them at an earlier stage during the development process and may further inspire future research. Eight code patterns are found in our case study specifically for memory leaks caused by circular references in Python. The observed patterns can explain 91.64% of the memory leaks in the studied projects.

It also contributes to the development of problem-solving skills. In this paper, we present a methodological framework with four cycles that alternate between cooperative and individual learning approaches in addition to game-based and project-based learning. The presented framework is suitable for deployment in primary schools, regardless of the digital competencies and programming skills of the teachers. The framework was evaluated focusing on the approach (collaborative or competitive) that is more suitable for the first cycle in the multi-cycle scenario for learning to code from a demographic perspective (gender and urbanization), the relevancy of Bloom's taxonomy, and the achieved learning experience. Initial results confirm that this approach encourages the students to use the proposed tools for finding the solution, raising their interest and motivation for learning to code. The teachers who participated in the pilot study were satisfied with the proposed approach, both in terms of achieved learning outcomes and the level of training needed to obtain necessary teaching competencies.;"[Videnovik, Maja] Ctr Innovat & Digital Educ, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Vlahu-Gjorgievska, Elena] Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Trajkovik, Vladimir] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje, North Macedonia";"University of Wollongong; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje";Vlahu-Gjorgievska, E (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.;elenavg@uow.edu.au;"Vlahu-Gjorgievska, Elena/GLU-3802-2022; Vlahu-Gjorgievska, Elena/K-3707-2015; Trajkovik, Vladimir/K-9758-2019";"Vlahu-Gjorgievska, Elena/0000-0001-6160-5343; Vlahu-Gjorgievska, Elena/0000-0001-6160-5343; Trajkovik, Vladimir/0000-0001-8103-8059; Videnovik, Maja/0000-0002-9859-5051";;;;;43;6;7;0;38;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

OCL provides a strong intuition of coding for the developer while implementing by means of a fluent interface. The significant aspect of the OCL is to combine the methods of well-known platforms; MATLAB and JAVA, accordingly. Moreover, OCL supports a fluent interface so that users can extend a single line of codes by putting a dot between the methods because all the methods implemented actually return the host class. It was observed that the learning curve of the OCL is lower than the MATLAB and the native JAVA languages, and makes coding more readable, understandable, traceable, and enjoyable. In addition to this, the experiments revealed that the running performance of the OCL is quite comparable and can be used in a variety of diverse applications.

The results indicate that it is paramount to optimize smoothness of trajectories across all keyframes. However, for experts timing control remains an essential tool. Satisfying this dual goal is technically challenging because it requires giving up desirable properties in the optimization formulation. Second, informed by this study we propose a method that optimizes positional and temporal reference fit jointly. This allows to generate globally smooth trajectories, while retaining user control over reference timings. The formulation is posed as a variable, infinite horizon, contour-following algorithm. Finally, a comparative lab study indicates that our optimization scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of perceived usability and preference of resulting videos.

Researchers have described a variety of more sophisticated methods but these are typically not interactive, which is crucial for creative exploration. This paper introduces a simple, intuitive and interactive tool that allows non-experts to recolor an image by editing a color palette. This system is comprised of several components: a GUI that is easy to learn and understand, an efficient algorithm for creating a color palette from an image, and a novel color transfer algorithm that recolors the image based on a user-modified palette. We evaluate our approach via a user study, showing that it is faster and easier to use than two alternatives, and allows untrained users to achieve results comparable to those of experts using professional software.;"[Chang, Huiwen; Fried, Ohad; Liu, Yiming; Finkelstein, Adam] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [DiVerdi, Stephen] Google, Mountain View, CA USA";"Princeton University; Google Incorporated";Chang, HW (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;;"Liu, Yiming/HCG-9727-2022; Fried, Ohad/R-2688-2019";Fried, Ohad/0000-0001-7109-4006;"Adobe; Google; Google Graduate Fellowship";"Adobe; Google(Google Incorporated); Google Graduate Fellowship(Google Incorporated)";Most of the photos in this paper are courtesy of the MIT-Adobe FiveK Dataset [2011] which was created, described, and shared by Bychkovsky et al.

Some examples related to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) course are explored in this study. A CFD course provides tools for the numerical solution of fluid flows where an analytical cannot be found. Flows can be described by numerically solving the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations for incompressible fluids. A Chebyshev collocation spectral method has been used to solve the governing equations. A high-level functional programming language strategy was implemented in Mathematica including readability and adaptability. The programs are built by applying and composing functions, mappings, iterators, and pattern matching. It was noted that students can achieve a better comprehension of the algorithms using this programming approach.;"[Acosta-Zamora, Karla P.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Energias Renovables, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Nunez, Jose] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Morelia, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Morelos, Michoacan, Mexico";"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";Núñez, J (corresponding author), Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Morelia, Morelos 58190, Michoacan, Mexico.;joseng@enesmorelia.unam.mx;Gonzalez, Jose Nunez/JPA-2595-2023;Nunez Gonzalez, Jose/0000-0002-4579-3476;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog'a (CONACYT), Mexico;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog'a (CONACYT), Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT));Karla P.

J;"Aota, N; Kono, K";;;;"Aota, Naohiro; Kono, Kenji";;;File Systems are Hard to Test - Learning from Xfstests;IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"file system; code coverage; software test";;Modern file systems, such as ext4, btrfs, and XFS, are evolving and enable the introduction of new features to meet ever-changing demands and improve reliability. File system developers are struggling to eliminate all software bugs, but the operating system community points out that file systems are a hotbed of critical software bugs. This paper analyzes the code coverage of xfstests, a widely used suite of file system tests, on three major file systems (ext4, btrfs, and XFS). The coverage is 72.34%, and the uncovered code runs into 23,232 lines of code. To understand why the code coverage is low, the uncovered code is manually examined line by line. We identified three major causes, peculiar to file systems, that hinder higher coverage. First, covering all the features is difficult because each file system provides a wide variety of file-system specific features, and some features can be tested only on special storage devices. Second, covering all the execution paths is difficult because they depend on file system configurations and internal on-disk states. Finally, the code for maintaining backward-compatibility is executed only when a file system encounters old formats. Our findings will help file system developers improve the coverage of test suites and provide insights into fostering the development of new methodologies for testing file systems.;"[Aota, Naohiro; Kono, Kenji] Keio Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan";Keio University;Aota, N (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.;naota@sslab.ics.keio.ac.jp;;;JSPS KAKENHI [JP16J03272, JP16K00104];JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI));This work is partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16J03272, JP16K00104.;;23;3;3;0;1;IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG;TOKYO;KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN;1745-1361;;;IEICE T INF SYST;IEICE Trans.

Although refactorings are relevant to improve the quality of software source code, they unfortunately suffer from severe usability issues. In particular, the extract method refactoring, one of the most prominent refactorings, has a failure rate of 49% when users attempt to use it. Objective: Our main objective is to improve the success rate of applying the extract method refactoring. Methods: First, to understand the cause of refactoring failure, we conducted a partial replication of Vakilian's ICSE '14 study about usability issues of refactoring using IntelliJ IDEA. Second, we designed and implemented TOAD, a tool that proposes alternative text selection for source code refactoring for the Pharo programming language. Third, we evaluated TOAD using a controlled experiment against the standard Pharo code refactoring tool. Seven professional software engineers complemented with three undergrad students participated in our experiments. Conclusion: The causes we identified of failed extract method refactoring attempts match Vakilian's work. TOAD significantly reduces the number of failed attempts to run the extract method refactoring at a lower cognitive load cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

By using programming patterns and their implementations as computer programs, difficult new concepts can be smoothly taught in lectures to students who before trying this teaching approach would have been reluctant to enroll on Parallel and Concurrent Programming courses. The approach presented in this paper consists in changing the traditional programming teaching and learning model to one where students are first introduced to syntactical constructs through selected introductory program code-patterns. In the theory lessons that follow, through the use of laptops with multi-core processors and access to the Virtual Campus services of our university, the students are easily able to implement and master the new concepts as they are taught. This teaching experiment was implemented to teach a concurrent and real-time programming course which is part of the computer engineering (CE) degree and taught during the third semester of the CE curriculum. Evaluation of the students' academic performance when they had been taught with this approach revealed a 20.6% improvement in the students' end-of-course grades. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although this helps improve coding skills, students may not obtain sufficient educational effects if the assignment is too difficult. Instead of presenting a model answer to an assignment, this paper proposes an approach to provide students with problems that have content and answer source code similar to the assignment.

They will allow to identify critical hubs and routes of spreading of Influenza, in specific geographic locations, in order to contain infections and prevent complications, that require hospitalizations. Material and methods: Data were downloaded from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) - SID, New York State database. Patients hospitalized with flu complications, between 2003 and 2012 were included in the research (30,380 cases). A novel approach was designed, by constructing heatmaps for specific geographic regions in New York state and power law networks, in order to analyze distribution of hospitalized flu cases. Results: Heatmaps revealed that distributions of patients follow urban areas and big roads, indicating that flu spreads along routes, that people use to travel. A scale-free network, created from correlations among zip codes, discovered that, the highest populated zip codes didn't have the largest number of patients with flu complications. Among the top five most affected zip codes, four were in Bronx. Demographics of top affected zip codes were presented in results. Normalized numbers of cases per population revealed that, none of zip codes from Bronx were in the top 20. All zip codes with the highest node degrees were in New York City area. Discussion: Heatmaps identified geographic distribution of hospitalized flu patients and network analysis identified hubs of the infection. Our results will enable better estimation of resources for prevention and treatment of hospitalized patients with complications of Influenza. Conclusion: Analyses of geographic distribution of hospitalized patients with Influenza and demographic characteristics of populations, help us to make better planning and management of resources for Influenza patients, that require hospitalization. Obtained results could potentially help to save many lives and improve the health of the population.;"[Ljubic, Branimir; Gligorijevic, Djordje; Gligorijevic, Jelena; Pavlovski, Martin; Obradovic, Zoran] Temple Univ, Ctr Data Analyt & Biomed Informat DABI, SERC Bldg,1925 N 12th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA";"Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University";Obradovic, Z (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Ctr Data Analyt & Biomed Informat DABI, SERC Bldg,1925 N 12th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.;"branimir.ljubic@temple.edu; gligorijevic@temple.edu; jelena.stojanovic@temple.edu; tuh27103@temple.edu; zoran.obradovic@temple.edu";;"Obradovic, Zoran/0000-0002-2051-0142; Ljubic, Branimir/0000-0002-3287-3741";"NSF [SES-1659998, SES-1447670]; Pennsylvania Department of Health CURE Health Data Science Research Project Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality";"NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Pennsylvania Department of Health CURE Health Data Science Research Project Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality)";This research was supported in part by the NSF grant SES-1659998, SES-1447670 and Pennsylvania Department of Health CURE Health Data Science Research Project.

Only a few empirical investigations have been conducted to assess whether the kind of documentation for design patterns implemented in source code affects its comprehensibility. To investigate this aspect, we conducted a family of four controlled experiments with 88 participants having different experience (i.e., professionals and Bachelor, Master, and PhD students). In each experiment, the participants were divided into three groups and asked to comprehend a nontrivial chunk of an open-source software system. Depending on the group, each participant was, or was not, provided with graphical or textual representations of the design patterns implemented within the source code. We graphically documented design-pattern instances with UML class diagrams. Textually documented instances are directly reported source code as comments.

The violations of these usage constraints can lead to software crashes or security vulnerabilities. Several professional tools can detect these constraints (API misuses) in cryptography; however, in the educational programs, the focus has been less on helping students implement an application without cryptographic API misuses that are caused by either a lack of cryptographic knowledge or programming mistakes.To address the problem, we present an intelligent tutoring approach SSDTutor for edu-cating Secure Software Development. Our tutoring approach helps students or developers repair cryptographic API misuse defects by leveraging an automated program repair tech-nique based on the usage patterns of cryptographic APIs. We studied the best practices of cryptographic implementations and encoded eight cryptographic API usage patterns. For quality feedback, we leverage a clone detection technique to recommend related feedback for helping students understand why their programs are incorrect, rather than blindly ac-cepting repairs.We evaluated SSDTutor on 456 open source subject projects implemented with crypto-graphic APIs. SSDTutor successfully detected 1,553 out of 1,573 misuse defects with 98.9% accuracy and repaired 1,551 out of 1,573 misuse defects with 99.3% accuracy.

Such a pedagogy is known as work-integrated learning (WIL). In a low-code WIL course, the focus is on the practical development experiences and the delivery of a business application based on client's requirements. Yet, the real-world ISD experiences may inhibit metacognition, which is essential for students to succeed in future learning of digital innovations. Without metacognition, students struggle to learn how to learn and be reflective about their learning. This study uses a mixed-method design and draws on Flavell's (1979) theoretical framework to examine metacognition in the context of low-code WIL. In particular, the study examines the effect of learner-oriented factors and task-oriented factors on metacognition and its impact on learning outcomes, such as knowledge confidence, app delivery, and grade. The quantitative results indicate that metacognition is influenced by motivation, the strategic approach, and autonomy, whereas self-efficacy beliefs have no effect. The learning outcomes are also achieved. Qualitative results (students' essays and apps) corroborate the quantitative results while also providing additional insights into the learning in low-code WIL showing the impact of the platform and agile ISD practices on metacognition. Overall, this study offers IS educators a better understanding of how low-code platforms can foster learning-to-learn while providing real-world practical experiences.;"[Matook, Sabine; Wang, Yazhu Maggie] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane 4072, Australia; [Koeppel, Nuria] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Business Informat Syst, Brisbane, Australia; [Guerin, Simon] Siemens Digital Ind Software, Melbourne, Australia";"University of Queensland; University of Queensland";Matook, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane 4072, Australia.;s.matook@business.uq.edu.au;;"Matook, Sabine/0000-0001-9520-5743; Wang, Yazhu (Maggie)/0000-0002-0815-0789";Australian Research Council [DP160100431];Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council);The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (DP160100431);;199;2;2;19;40;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0268-3962;1466-4437;;J INF TECHNOL-UK;J.

One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop.

Like the Web, huge number of hyperlinked data exist on the Semantic Web which results in the Web of Linked Data. In addition, one can easily encounter hyperlinked multimedia data such as image files, video clips, etc. on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we propose a browsing system called LIDAB which shows user-friendly views of different types of linked multimedia data sources on the Semantic Web. The motivation behind our research is to provide lay users without technical backgrounds on the Semantic Web with intuitive views on the linked multimedia data. While there exist well-known linked data browsing systems such as Tabulator, Disco, etc., using these systems are not always easy for novice users since they do not show intuitive views on browser screens. On the other hand, our system generates a view that looks almost like a normal HTML view that one can see on a Web browser. Our system has two types of audience: non-expert users who browse the information on the Semantic Web and Web designers who can create HTML documents.

GSD allows civil engineering students to create a virtual simulation environment in which an effective and appropriate teaching-learning process can be experienced. The GSD environment is programmed in Matlab using a finite element-based mathematical framework. Furthermore, as the analysis of silo structures is highly relevant in real engineering projects, students can acquire fundamental knowledge for their future works as engineers.

The personal learning environment (PLE) pedagogical design was introduced to assist students' Statistics learning. With the PLE pedagogy, this study examined learners' demographic backgrounds, motivational measures (i.e., help-seeking and academic procrastination due to the use of Information and Communication Technologies, ICT), and ill-structured data (i.e., Facebook posts and comments) to understand what student demographic information, how they feel, and what they do can impact their statistics learning performance. Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students' cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size. The study contributed to developing an integrated learner-centered learning analytics framework with the PLE pedagogical design encompassing learner backgrounds and unstructured learner artifacts.;[Wu, Jiun-Yu] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Educ, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan;National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University;Wu, JY (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Educ, 1001 Univ Rd, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan.;jiunyu.rms@gmail.com;Wu, Jiun-Yu/D-6668-2013;Wu, Jiun-Yu/0000-0002-3160-9658;Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [108-2511-H-009 -013 -MY3];Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);This research was partially supported by 108-2511-H-009 -013 -MY3 from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.;;99;27;29;11;114;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

However, the available software simulators that are used to write and run assembly programs do not fulfill the students' expectations due to being difficult to deal with and lacking a lot of necessary GUI features. In this article, we introduce a new Assembly Language Teaching Aid (ALTA32 or ALTA8086) which is basically a simulator that helps much in delivering concepts related to assembly language programming course for Intel microprocessors (mu ps). Among current and relevant simulators, ALTA32 not only is the simplest and easiest to use, but also has the most fascinating user-friendly interface that exhibits constructive and informative features. Additionally, it offers multiple run modes with the option of writing programs directly or through loading existing files. It works efficiently in both 16-bit and 32-bit extensions considering real mode memory addressing. It supports all data and stack memory addressing modes along with all available directives to be used in both model and full-segment program approaches. Furthermore, to understand and recognize changes after execution, all affected fields are emphasized and shown using visual effects such as dynamic labels, blinking texts, as well as colored codes. On the other hand, it is widely known that the Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architecture, which is also a register-memory architecture, is characterized by affording many instructions with various operands, affected flags, complex operations, and sources of syntax errors. Although it is really challenging to build up a simulator that completely supports that wide range of Intel assembly instructions taking into account the variety in their lengths and formats, we succeeded eventually to eliminate the code redundancy and make our code readable, maintainable, and scalable through programming all instructions based on the methodology of combining or grouping all instructions that almost act similarly to follow a certain efficient algorithm. As a programming environment, VB.Net has been used to develop the ALTA32 simulator. Throughout our experience in teaching assembly 8086 language programming course for CISC processors, we found many difficulties in getting the students familiar with well-known simulators such as Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM8086 or MASM32) or 8086 mu p Emulator (EMU8086). Nevertheless, the feedback from our students about ALTA32 simulator was so impressive and the complaints were totally disappeared. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The introduction of clone groups and clone genealogies enable software developers to be aware of the presence of and changes to clones as a collective group; they also allow developers to understand how clone groups evolve throughout software life cycle. Due to similarity in codes within a clone group, a change in one piece of the code may require developers to make consistent change to other clones in the group. Failure in making such consistent change to a clone group when necessary is commonly known as clone consistency-defect, which can adversely impact software reusability. In this work, we propose an approach to predict the need for making consistent change in clones within a clone group at the time when changes have been made to one of its clones. We build a variant of clone genealogies to collect all consistent/inconsistent changes to clone groups, and extract three attribute sets from clone groups as input for predicting the need for consistent clone change. These three attribute sets are code attributes, context attributes and evolution attributes respectively. Together, they provide a holistic view about clone changes. We conduct experiments on four open source projects. Our experiments show that our approach has reasonable precision and recall in predicting whether a clone group requires (or is free of) consistent change. This holistic approach can aid developers in maintaining clone changes, and avoid potential consistency-defect, which can improve software quality and reusability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A lack of theoretical and empirical research devoted to understanding coding education acceptance provided the motivation for this article. As a way to engage in the debate, this article investigated kindergarten teachers' acceptance of coding education by drawing on the theory of planned behavior framework, with self-efficacy, pedagogical beliefs, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, student readiness, teacher readiness, and parent readiness serving as external factors. The data were obtained from 236 in-service and preservice teachers in South Korea. Partial least square was employed to evaluate the research hypotheses. We find that self-efficacy and pedagogical beliefs exert a positive effect on perceived behavioral control. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are pertinent for forming positive attitudes. Teacher readiness and parent readiness matter for generating positive subjective norm. Perceived behavioral control, attitude, and subjective norm all have a positive effect on behavioral intentions. The positive indirect effect of perceived usefulness on behavioral intentions through attitude is also noteworthy. In this article, we provide exploratory results as to how teachers believe and perceive coding in early childhood education.

However, despite the multiple features offered by neural modelling tools, their integration with environments for the simulation of robots and agents can be challenging and time consuming. The implementation of artificial neural circuits to control robots generally involves the following tasks: (1) understanding the simulation tools, (2) creating the neural circuit in the neural simulator, (3) linking the simulated neural circuit with the environment of the agent and (4) programming the appropriate interface in the robot or agent to use the neural controller. The accomplishment of the above-mentioned tasks can be challenging, especially for undergraduate students or novice researchers. This paper presents an alternative tool which facilitates the simulation of simple SNN circuits using the multi-agent simulation and the programming environment Netlogo (educational software that simplifies the study and experimentation of complex systems). The engine proposed and implemented in Netlogo for the simulation of a functional model of SNN is a simplification of integrate and fire (I&F) models. The characteristics of the engine (including neuronal dynamics, STDP learning and synaptic delay) are demonstrated through the implementation of an agent representing an artificial insect controlled by a simple neural circuit. The setup of the experiment and its outcomes are described in this work.;"[Jimenez-Romero, Cristian; Johnson, Jeffrey] Open Univ, Design Complex Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England";Open University - UK;Jimenez-Romero, C (corresponding author), Open Univ, Design Complex Grp, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.;cristian.jimenez-romero@open.ac.uk;;Johnson, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2672-3197;;;;;24;6;6;1;12;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0941-0643;1433-3058;;NEURAL COMPUT APPL;Neural Comput.

Despite the availability of studies providing a better understanding of surgeons' eye movements, research in the particular field of endoneurosurgery is very limited. Analysing surgeons' eye-movement data can provide general insights into how to improve surgical education programmes. In this study, four simulation-based task-oriented endoscopic surgery training scenarios were developed and implemented by 23 surgical residents using three different hand conditions; dominant, non-dominant, and both. The participants' recorded eye data comprised fixation number, fixation duration, saccade number, saccade duration, pursuit number, pursuit duration, and pupil size. This study has two main contributions: First, it reports on the eye-movement behaviours of surgical residents, demonstrating that novice residents tended to make more fixations and saccades than intermediate residents. They also had a higher fixation duration and followed the objects more frequently compared to the intermediates. Furthermore, hand conditions significantly affected the eye movements of the participants. Based on these results, it can be concluded that eye-movement data can be used to assess the skill levels of surgical residents and would be an important measure to better guide trainees in surgical education programmes. The second contribution of this study is the eye-movement event classifications of 10 different algorithms. Although the algorithms mostly provided similar results, there were a few conflicted values for some classifications, which offers a clue as to how researchers can utilise these algorithms with low sampling frequency eye trackers.";"[Dalveren, Gonca Gokce Menekse; Cagiltay, Nergiz Ercil] Atilim Univ, Dept Software Engn, Fac Engn, Ankara, Turkey";Atilim University;Dalveren, GGM (corresponding author), Atilim Univ, Dept Software Engn, Fac Engn, Ankara, Turkey.;goncagmenekse@gmail.com;"Cagiltay, Nergiz/O-3082-2019; Menekse Dalveren, Gonca Gokce/HHS-4591-2022";"Cagiltay, Nergiz/0000-0003-0875-9276; Menekse Dalveren, Gonca Gokce/0000-0002-8649-1909";TUBITAK [112K287];TUBITAK(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK));This work was supported by TUBITAK [112K287].;;65;18;20;0;18;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0144-929X;1362-3001;;BEHAV INFORM TECHNOL;Behav.

Aortic dissections require rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment; thus, in order to optimize patient outcomes, clinicians must be accessible, data must be readily available, and proper prompts and notifications must be made to alert and ready teams. An interdisciplinary team reviewed our hospital's processes and architecture of systems to define how we provide care during aortic emergencies. Based on this insight into patient flow, we ultimately developed a Code Aorta protocol to streamline provision of care during aortic emergencies. This process focused on protocol development, human-technology interfaces, and outcome-oriented metrics. The team also aimed to heighten awareness of the emergent process and to understand relevant outcomes data. After introduction of the Code Aorta protocol, a 78% reduction was achieved in time-to-treatment from the previous year's average time. In addition, the average length of stay was reduced by 2.4 days (18%). The team's efforts focused on clinical communication, aiming to link technology to maximize clinical efficiency. The initial results of our Code Aorta protocol show promise that continual refinement of patient care processes during aortic emergencies will improve outcomes for patients suffering aortic dissection.";"[Moats, Susan K.] Texas Christian Univ, Harris Coll Nursing & Hlth Sci, TCU Box 298627, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Richard, B.

However, successful onboarding is always challenging because newcomers face various initial contributing barriers. To support newcomer onboarding, OSS communities widely adopt the mentoring approach. Despite its significance, previous mentoring studies tend to focus on the newcomer's perspective, leaving the mentor's perspective relatively under-studied. To better support mentoring, we study the popular Google Summer of Code (GSoC). It is a well-established global program that offers stipends and mentors to students aiming to bring more student developers into OSS development. We combine online data analysis, an email survey, and semi-structured interviews with the GSoC mentors to understand their motivations, challenges, strategies, and gains. We propose a taxonomy of GSoC mentors' engagement with four themes, ten categories, 34 sub-categories, and 118 codes, as well as the mentors' attitudes toward the codes. In particular, we find that mentors participating in GSoC are primarily intrinsically motivated, and some new motivators emerge adapting to the contemporary challenges, e.g., sustainability and advertisement of projects. Forty-one challenges and 52 strategies associated with the program timeline are identified, most of which are first time revealed. Although almost all the challenges are agreed upon by specific mentors, some mentors believe that several challenges are reasonable and even have a positive effect. For example, the cognitive differences between mentors and mentees can stimulate new perspectives. Most of the mentors agreed that they had adopted these strategies during the mentoring process, but a few strategies recommended by the GSoC administration were not agreed upon. Self-satisfaction, different skills, and peer recognition are the main gains of mentors to participate in GSoC. Eventually, we discuss practical implications for mentors, students, OSS communities, GSoC programs, and researchers.;"[Tan, Xin; Zhang, Li] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Minghui] Peking Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China";"Beihang University; Peking University";Zhang, L (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Software Dev Environm, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;"xintan@buaa.edu.cn; zhmh@pku.edu.cn; lily@buaa.edu.cn";;"Zhang, Li/0000-0002-2258-5893; Zhou, Minghui/0000-0001-6324-3964; Tan, Xin/0000-0003-1099-3336";"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62202022, 62141209, 61825201]; State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment [SKLSDE-2022ZX-08]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment";This work was supported in part by the National Natural ScienceFoundation of China under Grants 62202022, 62141209, and 61825201, and inpart by Self-determined Research Funds of the State Key Laboratory of SoftwareDevelopment Environment under Grant SKLSDE-2022ZX-08.

J;Shoufan, A;;;;Shoufan, Abdulhadi;;;Exploring Students' Perceptions of ChatGPT: Thematic Analysis and Follow-Up Survey;IEEE ACCESS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"ChatGPT; students' perceptions; education";USER ACCEPTANCE;ChatGPT has sparked both excitement and skepticism in education. To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program (n = 56). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT's answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.;[Shoufan, Abdulhadi] Khalifa Univ, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates;Khalifa University of Science & Technology;Shoufan, A (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Ctr Cyber Phys Syst, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.;abdulhadi.shoufan@ku.ac.ae;;;Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Program, Ministry of Education, United Arab Emirates;Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Program, Ministry of Education, United Arab Emirates;This work was supported by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Program, Ministry of Education, United Arab Emirates.;;38;75;76;82;480;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;38805;38818;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268224;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268224;;;14;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";F1DD0;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000979812500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is extremely difficult to visually represent or model ionised nebula, requiring astronomers to employ sophisticated modelling code to derive temperature, density and chemical composition. Existing codes are available that often require steep learning curves and produce models derived from mathematical functions. In this article we will introduce PYCROss: PYCLOUDY Rendering Of SHAPE Software. This is a pseudo 3D modelling application that generates photoionisation models of optically thin nebulae, created using the SHAPE software. Currently PYCROss has been used for novae and planetary nebulae, and it can be extended to Active Galactic Nuclei or any other type of photoionised axisymmetric nebulae. Functionality, an operational overview, and a scientific pipeline will be described with scenarios where PYCROss has been adopted for novae (V5668 Sagittarii (2015) & V4362 Sagittarii (1994)) and a planetary nebula (LoTr1). Unlike the aforementioned photoionised codes this application neither requires any coding experience, nor the need to derive complex mathematical models, instead utilising the select features from CLOUDY / PYCLOUDY and SHAPE. The software was developed using a formal software development lifecycle, written in Python and will work without the need to install any development environments or additional python packages. This application, SHAPE models and PYCROss archive examples are freely available to students, academics and research community on GitHub for download. (C) 2020 The Authors.

J;Luo, L;;;;Luo, Li;;;A Study on the Application of Computer-Aided Dual-Coding Theory in English Vocabulary Teaching;SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Learning English needs a huge amount of vocabulary recalls as well as multiple grammatical structures and practices. With the development and improvement of the humanization and quality of English teaching, the multidimensional teaching of English has formed a powerful learning model and teaching method. The teaching of dual-coding theory assisted by computer teaching software mainly focuses on the dual activation representation of language combined with nonverbal graphic recognition to complete the recognition of information. According to the dual-coding hypothesis, in Gilford's intelligence theory, the capacity of spatial and information recognition and reading is highly significant. With the large amount of visual recognition and information acquisition, images involve spatial domain information reading, which is a learning method based on the principle of information feature recognition. Based on the principle of dual-coding theory, it is a very effective way to present information and recall specific information in the form of vision and language. In this study, the application research for the purpose of English vocabulary teaching is adopted that has strong innovative and practical characteristics. According to the steps and contents of English vocabulary learning, the study is carried out step by step from the context in detail, so it continuously improves the learning quality and efficiency of English vocabulary teaching. Vocabulary teaching can help the students better improve their cognitive level of vocabulary and meet the vocabulary test requirements of the new institution entrance examination. Further, how to improve the effect of senior high school English vocabulary teaching is a major topic in the field of senior high school English teaching. In order to sort out this issue, I proposed a computer-aided dual-coding theory to help quickly understand vocabulary usage in order to increase learning efficiency. The Paivio-Desrochers model is used in this study. In addition, this study also attempts to explore the application of dual-coding theory in senior high school English vocabulary teaching.;[Luo, Li] Chongqing Metropolitan Coll Sci & Technol, Humanities Inst, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China;;Luo, L (corresponding author), Chongqing Metropolitan Coll Sci & Technol, Humanities Inst, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China.;luoli@cqcst.edu.cn;;;;;;;32;1;1;11;43;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1058-9244;1875-919X;;SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH;Sci.

J;"Weintrop, D; Wilensky, U";;;;"Weintrop, David; Wilensky, Uri";;;Transitioning from introductory block-based and text-based environments to professional programming languages in high school computer science classrooms;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Evaluation of CAL systems; Interactive learning environments; Programming and programming languages; Secondary education; Teaching/leaming strategies";LEARNING ANALYTICS;Block-based programming languages are becoming increasingly common in introductory computer science classrooms across the K-12 spectrum. One justification for the use of block-based environments in formal educational settings is the idea that the concepts and practices developed using these introductory tools will prepare learners for future computer science learning opportunities. This view is built on the assumption that the attitudinal and conceptual learning gains made while working in the introductory block-based environments will transfer to conventional text-based programming languages. To test this hypothesis, this paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental classroom study in which programming novices spent five-week using either a block-based or text-based programming environment. After five weeks in the introductory tool, students transitioned to Java, a conventional text-based programming language. The study followed students for 10 weeks after the transition. Over the course of the 15-week study, attitudinal and conceptual assessments were administered and student-authored programs were collected. Conceptual learning, attitudinal shifts, and changes in programming practices were analyzed to evaluate how introductory modality impacted learners as they transitioned to a professional, text-based programming language. The findings from this study build on earlier work that found a difference in performance on content assessments after the introductory portion of the study (Weintrop & Wilensky, 2017a). This paper shows the difference in conceptual learning that emerged after five weeks between the block-based and text-based conditions fades after 10 weeks in Java. No differences in programming practices were found between the two conditions while working in Java. Likewise, differences in attitudinal measures that emerged after working in the introductory environments also faded after 10 weeks in Java, resulting in no difference between the conditions after 15 weeks. The contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of the benefits and limits of block-based programming tools in preparing students for future computer science learning. This paper presents the first quasi-experimental study of the transfer of knowledge between block-based and text-based environments in a high school setting. The lack of significant differences between the two introductory programming modalities after learners transition to professional programming languages is discussed along with the implications of these findings for computer science education researchers and educators, as well as for the broader community of researchers studying the role of technology in education.;"[Weintrop, David] Univ Maryland, Coll Educ, Coll Informat Studies, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Wilensky, Uri] Northwestern Univ, Ctr Connected Learning & Comp Based Modeling, Evanston, IL 60208 USA";"University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Northwestern University";Weintrop, D (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Coll Educ, Coll Informat Studies, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;weintrop@umd.edu;Wilensky, Uriel/B-7279-2009;Weintrop, David/0000-0002-3009-3899;;;;;91;60;65;2;465;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

However, current SLEs have two limitations: (1) not all of these characteristics are included, particularly lacking collaborative knowledge construction, in most cases; and (2) most SLEs are designed to support learning activities outdoors, but not indoors. This paper presents the implementation of an SLE that overcomes these two limitations. This SLE is based on bidirectional Quick Response (QR) codes, which are enhanced QR codes that not only provide information when scanned but also collect usergenerated content. This Bidirectional SLE is evaluated in an experiment in which it is compared with an equivalent Traditional SLE, which is built upon traditional QR codes. The purpose of this comparison is to understand if using bidirectional QR codes as a mechanism to support collaborative knowledge construction in indoor settings has an impact on students' learning outcomes and on their impression of the learning experience. Two hundred fifty-three students participated in this experiment. Data collected from this experiment indicate that the students who worked in the Bidirectional SLE (1) received better scores, providing better and more complete answers, and (2) evaluated their learning experience better than their peers' who worked in the Traditional SLE. Finally, a cross-analysis of these results including teachers' opinions led to a set of lessons learned about the design of SLEs to support collaborative knowledge construction.

Although modern computational techniques for data analysis such as simulation, randomization, and bootstrapping have the potential to make the idea of randomness more concrete, representing such random processes with R code is not as easy for students to understand as is something like a coin-flip, which is both concrete and embodied. In this study, in the context of multimedia learning, we designed and tested the efficacy of an instructional sequence that preceded computational simulations with embodied demonstrations. We investigated the role that embodied hands-on movement might play in facilitating students' understanding of the shuffle function in R. Our findings showed that students who watched a video of hands shuffling data written on pieces of paper learned more from a subsequent live-coding demonstration of randomization using R than did students only introduced to the concept using R. Although others have found an advantage of students themselves engaging in hands-on activities, this study showed that merely watching someone else engage can benefit learning.

It is challenging to comprehend for computer novices or machines. Therefore, a textual explanation is provided to illustrate the algorithm. To understand an algorithm, a method needs to be devised to find or generate the corresponding text description and vice versa. This paper matches an algorithm in a variety of forms, such as pseudocode and hand-drawn flowchart, with the illustrative text written in English to facilitate a thorough understanding of the algorithm. The experiment includes a proposed set of rules for generating pseudocode from a hand-drawn flowchart and a proposed S-DistilBERT-based transfer learning method to determine the similarity match score between multiple forms of algorithm and text description. Basic block and line identification, as well as OCR-ization, are used to characterize the hand-drawn flowcharts. The experimental result show that we can generate the equivalent pseudocode in 85% cases, and our fine-tuned S-DistilBERT model can accommodate the matching text for the existing pseudocode with 75.59% and the generated pseudocode with 74.57% accuracy. We also find the appropriate description from an algorithm in the top five matches in 30 out of 50 cases.

Recently, a promising Deep Learning (DL) based solution, called Copilot, has been proposed by OpenAI and Microsoft as an industrial product. Although some studies evaluate the correctness of Copilot solutions and report its issues, more empirical evaluations are necessary to understand how developers can benefit from it effectively. In this paper, we study the capabilities of Copilot in two different programming tasks: (i) generating (and reproducing) correct and efficient solutions for fundamental algorithmic problems, and (ii) comparing Copilot's proposed solutions with those of human programmers on a set of programming tasks. For the former, we assess the performance and functionality of Copilot in solving selected fundamental problems in computer science, like sorting and implementing data structures. In the latter, a dataset of programming problems with human-provided solutions is used. The results show that Copilot is capable of providing solutions for almost all fundamental algorithmic problems, however, some solutions are buggy and non-reproducible. Moreover, Copilot has some difficulties in combining multiple methods to generate a solution. Comparing Copilot to humans, our results show that the correct ratio of humans' solutions is greater than Copilot's suggestions, while the buggy solutions generated by Copilot require less effort to be repaired. Based on our findings, if Copilot is used by expert developers in software projects, it can become an asset since its suggestions could be comparable to humans' contributions in terms of quality. However, Copilot can become a liability if it is used by novice developers who may fail to filter its buggy or non-optimal solutions due to a lack of expertise. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.";"[Lai, Chin-Feng; Zhong, Hua-Xu] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Chiu, Po-Sheng] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept E Learning Design & Management, 85 Wenlong, Minxiong Township 621, Chiayi County, Taiwan";National Cheng Kung University;Chiu, PS (corresponding author), Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept E Learning Design & Management, 85 Wenlong, Minxiong Township 621, Chiayi County, Taiwan.;chiups@mail.ncyu.edu.tw;"Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023; Demir, Fatma/GWZ-5156-2022; Lai, Chin-Feng/IAP-5353-2023";Lai, Chin-Feng/0000-0001-7138-0272;Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST110-2511-H-006-011-MY3, MOST108-2511-H-415-003-MY3];Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);"This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [Grant number: MOST110-2511-H-006-011-MY3; MOST108-2511-H-415-003-MY3].";;82;8;8;12;130;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Machine learning has streamlined processes, offering a seamless means of elevating the quality of education and training provided to students, particularly in the context of sports. This technological support empowers the sports education system to make more informed decisions pertaining to the physical development of aspiring athletes. In this comprehensive study, a blended approach of qualitative methods has been leveraged to gather intricate insights, enriching the overall understanding of the subject. Additionally, an in-depth exploration of articles and journals has been undertaken to scrutinize the practical implementation of data algorithm techniques geared towards enhancing physical training. The resultant findings underscore a substantial and tangible nexus between data algorithms and the domain of sports education. Of paramount significance is the central role played by data mining algorithms in augmenting performance. Notably, the National Sports Board (NSB) has extensively harnessed this technology to meticulously monitor players' on-field performance, ultimately leading to a granular comprehension of each player's capabilities.

The data should be communicated securely between the communicating devices and therefore, network security is one of the dominant research areas for the current network scenario. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are therefore widely used along with other security mechanisms such as firewall and access control. Many research ideas have been proposed pertaining to the IDS using machine learning (ML) techniques, deep learning (DL) techniques, and swarm and evolutionary algorithms (SWEVO). These methods have been tested on the datasets such as DARPA, KDD CUP 99, and NSL-KDD using network features to classify attack types. This paper surveys the intrusion detection problem by considering algorithms from areas such as ML, DL, and SWEVO. The survey is a representative research work carried out in the field of IDS from the year 2008 to 2020. The paper focuses on the methods that have incorporated feature selection in their models for performance evaluation. The paper also discusses the different datasets of IDS and a detailed description of recent dataset CIC IDS-2017. The paper presents applications of IDS with challenges and potential future research directions.

A tool has been developed to help programmers write readable comments and measure their readability level. It is used to enhance software readability by providing alternatives to both keywords and comment statements from a local database and an online dictionary. It is also a word-finding query engine for developers. Readability level is measured using three different formulas: the fog index, the Flesch reading ease score, and Flesch-Kincaid grade levels. A questionnaire has been distributed to 42 programmers and 35 students to compare the readability aspect between both new comments written by the tool and the original comments written by previous programmers and developers. Programmers stated that the comments from the proposed tool had fewer complex words and took less time to read and understand. Nevertheless, this did not significantly affect the understandability of the text, as programmers normally have quite a high level of English. However, the results from students show that the tool affects the understandability of text and the time taken to read it, while text complexity results show that the tool makes new comment text that is more readable by changing the three studied variables.;"[Eleyan, Derar] Palestine Tech Univ Kadoorie, Appl Comp Dept, POB 7, Tulkarem, Palestine; [Othman, Abed] Birzeit Univ, Comp Sci Dept, POB 14, Birzeit, Palestine; [Eleyan, Amna] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Comp & Math, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England";"Palestine Technical University - Kadoorie; Birzeit University; Manchester Metropolitan University";Eleyan, D (corresponding author), Palestine Tech Univ Kadoorie, Appl Comp Dept, POB 7, Tulkarem, Palestine.;"d.eleyan@ptuk.edu.ps; aothman@birzeit.edu; A.Eleyan@mmu.ac.uk";"Eleyan, Derar/F-9828-2013; Eleyan, Amna/JJC-1974-2023";"Eleyan, Derar/0000-0001-8876-7019; Eleyan, Amna/0000-0002-2025-3027; Othman, Abed/0000-0003-2120-9113";;;;;34;15;19;1;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;SEP;2020;11;9;;;;;;;430;10.3390/info11090430;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info11090430;;;25;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;OF0WU;;gold, Green Published;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000580940300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

More is needed to be known about the impact of unequal distribution of work on the performance of student software engineering teams and their members and the relationship between objective measures of unequal contribution and team-perceived unequal contribution. A greater understanding of these issues allows for targeted and personalised responses to these behaviours. We investigated several aspects of unequal contribution in student software engineering teams. We measured inequality of contribution using Git data from student software engineering teams, source code quality using code analyser SonarQube, and the team performance using grades. According to our results, most students under-contributed to their teams, and at least half the teams in each assignment had low equality of contribution or extreme inequality of contribution. Individual contribution styles did not strongly persist between modules (one-semester long software engineering courses). There were no consistent associations between inequality of contribution in the student teams and performance or code quality. When the contribution of the least active team member was less than 14% of their fair share, teams were likely to perceive an unequal distribution of contributions. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, many static approaches to JavaScript program analysis and the strict mode of ECMAScript 5 simply disallow the with statement. To justify exclusion of the with statement, we should better understand the actual usage patterns of the with statement. In this paper, we present the usage patterns of the with statement in real-world JavaScript applications currently used in the 898 most popular web sites. We investigate whether we can rewrite the with statements in each pattern to other statements not using the with statement. We show that we can rewrite all the static occurrences of the with statement that do not have any dynamic code generating functions. Even though the rewriting process is not applicable to any dynamically generated with statements, our results are still promising. Because all the static approaches that disallow the with statement also disallow dynamic code generation, such static approaches can allow the with statement using our rewriting process. We formally present our rewriting strategy, provide its implementation, and show its faithfulness using extensive testing. We believe that removing with statements will simplify JavaScript program analysis designs without considering dynamic scope introduction while imposing fewer syntactic restrictions.;"[Park, Changhee; Lee, Hongki; Ryu, Sukyoung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Taejon, South Korea";Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST);Park, C (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Taejon, South Korea.;"changhee.park@kaist.ac.kr; petitkan@kaist.ac.kr; sryu.cs@kaist.ac.kr";"Ryu, Sukyoung/C-2080-2011; Ryu, Sukyoung/A-8543-2015";Ryu, Sukyoung/0000-0002-0019-9772;;;;;25;2;3;0;12;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;0362-1340;1558-1160;;ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES;ACM Sigplan Not.;FEB;2014;49;2;;;;;73;84;;10.1145/2508168.2508173;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2508168.2508173;;;12;Computer Science, Software Engineering;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)";Computer Science;AA5FH;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000331121000008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Likewise, researchers in brain-computer interface (BCI) have recently employed deep learning (DL) algorithms for decoding and analyzing neural signals. Despite its outstanding performance, the BCI technology with the DLs has pointed out that it has a potential problem of low transparency due to algorithmic complexity of the models. On this problem, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be a solution to make an AI algorithm and its decisions more interpretable. However, the explanation from the XAI has been emphasized that it should be designed corresponding with the user's different expectations which are contextually variable. Thus, our study aims to propose an explanation interface for the BCI expert under Pragmatism structuralizing an explanation with scientific knowledge in a contrastive manner. For this work, we conduct a contextual design process with five BCI experts, specifically conducting a contextual inquiry and work modeling to extract design requirements from their expertise in their work environment; next, designing and evaluating an interactive prototype of the explanation interface. The results indicated that our prototype has the advantages of increasing contextual understanding and intuitive interface design. Yet, there were also challenges on the explanation for novice users without prior knowledge on the XAI and objective understanding of the AI model with enough interpretability. This study contributes to providing a theoretical framework based on Pragmatism and designing a user-centered XAI system for domain experts in a specific context.";"[Kim, Sangyeon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Interact Sci, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Choo, Sanghyun; Nam, Chang S.] North Carolina State Univ, Edward P Fitts Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Park, Donghyun; Park, Hoonseok; Jung, Jae-Yoon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Big Data Analyt, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Nam, Chang S.; Jung, Jae-Yoon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, Yongin 17104, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Sangwon] Korea Univ, Sch Ind & Management Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea";"Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); North Carolina State University; Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University; Korea University";Lee, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Sch Ind & Management Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.;upcircle@korea.ac.kr;"Jung, Jae-Yoon/B-6554-2013; Kim, Sangyeon/JGE-0077-2023";"Kim, Sangyeon/0000-0001-9316-7982; nam, chang/0000-0001-9005-0703; Choo, Sanghyun/0000-0002-8884-3437; Lee, Sangwon/0000-0002-9825-0854";"MSIT (Ministry of Science, ICT), Korea, under the High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program [2020001560]; Institute for Information amp; communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2022-0-00078]";"MSIT (Ministry of Science, ICT), Korea, under the High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program(Ministry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Institute for Information amp; communications Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)";This research was supported by the MSIT (Ministry of Science, ICT), Korea, under the High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program (No. 2020001560) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation) .

Populations urge these improvements to combat these diseases more effectively. The literature presents several authors defending the idea that epidemiologists should be able to develop causal models. In this area, the technique of structural equation models (SEM) has stood out in scientific research. Although SEM has been widely used in several research areas, it has been little explored by epidemiologists. Despite its evolution and efficiency, SEM has a gap in terms of discovering causalities. To fill this gap, this study developed an R package called BNPA, whose methodology joins the best of Bayesian network structural learning algorithms (BNSL) from data and path analysis (PA) a SEM subarea. The BNPA was built with pre-processing functions. Its main algorithm allows creating an input model to start the PA from a data set semi-automatically generating information to analyze the PA performance. An analysis of cardiovascular disease's main predictors was performed using the BNPA with data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Multiple linear regression (MR) was used as a gold standard methodology; the results of BNPA matched 85% of MR results. In conclusion, BNPA is efficient and can benefit researchers, mainly novices, by enabling them to build PA models from data. Furthermore, statisticians and PA experts will have more time to support these researchers instead of creating an initial model.

Materials and Methods: A 3-week AI workshop was designed by radiology faculty, residents, and AI engineers. The workshop was integrated into curricular academic half-days of a competency-based medical education radiology training program. The workshop consisted of live didactic lectures, literature case studies, and programming examples for consolidation. Learning objectives and content were developed for foundational literacy rather than technical proficiency. Identical prospective surveys were conducted before and after the workshop to gauge the participants' confidence in understanding AI concepts on a five-point Likert scale.Results were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon rank sum tests to evaluate differences. Results: Twelve residents participated in the workshop, with 11 completing the survey. An average score of 4.0 +/- 0.7 (SD), indicating agreement, was observed when asking residents if the workshop improved AI knowledge. Confidence in understanding AI concepts increased following the workshop for 16 of 18 (89%) comprehension questions (P value range: .001 to .04 for questions with increased confidence). Conclusion: An introductory AI workshop was developed and delivered to radiology residents. The workshop provided a condensed introduction to foundational AI concepts, developed positive perception, and improved confidence in AI topics.;"[Hu, Ricky; Li, Anthony] Queens Univ, Sch Med, 76 Stuart St, Kingston, ON K7L 2V7, Canada; [Hu, Ricky; Rizwan, Arsalan; Hu, Zoe; Chung, Andrew David; Kwan, Benjamin Y.

As a result, industrial end-user programmers may rely on programming languages and development environments that do not necessarily follow the stateof-the-art of software engineering. Consider Ladder Logic, the most popular language used to program the most widely deployed type of industrial hardware, programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Ladder Logic's fundamental design is based on electric relay circuits that have long since disappeared from practice. Does Ladder Logic inhibit the productivity of end-user programmers, slowing progress in industrial settings like manufacturing sites and scientific labs where it is widely used? To better understand the usage of domainspecific languages in industrial practices, we conducted a survey with 175 technical employees from an international engineering conglomerate. This survey introduced participants to Ladder Logic and asked them questions that all programmers, including novices, should answer with ease. Nearly 70% failed, including those with previous Ladder Logic experience. We combined end-user performance with answers in an open-ended question, where many employees complained about the programming language. The breadth and depth of these struggles suggest that outdated languages, which industrial end users must increasingly use, could dramatically impact productivity and that further studies on these industrial end user programmers be necessary to better support them in their increasingly complex workplaces.;"[Fronchetti, Felipe; Li, Linxi; Shepherd, David] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Ritschel, Nico; Holmes, Reid] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Soto, Mauricio] Hitachi ABB Power Grids, New York, NY USA; [Jetley, Raoul] ABB Corp Res, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Wiese, Igor] Fed Univ Technol, Parana, Brazil";"Virginia Commonwealth University; University of British Columbia; Hitachi Limited; ABB; ABB; Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana";Fronchetti, F (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;"fronchettl@vcu.edu; ritschel@cs.ubc.ca; rtholmes@cs.ubc.ca; lil24@vcu.edu; mausotog@hotmail.com; raoul.jetley@in.abb.com; igor@utfpr.edu.br; shepherdd@vcu.edu";;"Fronchetti Dias, Luiz Felipe/0000-0003-2104-6676; Shepherd, David C./0000-0003-2017-7842; Soto, Mauricio/0000-0002-1196-1646; Ritschel, Nico/0000-0001-5600-2978";National Science Foundation, USA [NRI-2024561];National Science Foundation, USA(National Science Foundation (NSF));Acknowledgments This study is supported by the National Science Foundation, USA under Grant NRI-2024561.;;94;10;10;1;5;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;2590-1184;2665-9182;;J COMPUT LANG;J.

Much less is known about the experiences of learners that affect their engagement with the course content. Through a case study employing text analysis of interview transcripts, we revealed the authentic voices of participants and gained a deeper understanding of motivations for and barriers to course engagements experienced by students participating in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). We sought to understand why learners take the courses, specifically Introduction to Chemistry or Data Analysis and Statistical Inference, and to identify factors both inside and outside of the course setting that impacted engagement and learning. Thirty-six participants in the courses were interviewed, and these students varied in age, experience with the subject matter, and worldwide geographical location. Most of the interviewee statements were neutral in attitude; sentiment analysis of the interview transcripts revealed that 80 percent of the statements that were either extremely positive or negative were found to be positive rather than negative, and this is important because an overall positive climate is known to correlate with higher academic achievement in traditional education settings. When demographic data was added to the sentiment analysis, students who have already earned bachelor's degrees were found to be more positive about the courses than students with either more or less formal education, and this was a highly statistically significant result. In general, students from America were more critical than students from Africa and Asia, and the sentiments of female participants' comments were generally less positive than those of male participants. An examination of student statements related to motivations revealed that knowledge, work, convenience, and personal interest were the most frequently coded nodes (more generally referred to as codes). On the other hand, lack of time was the most prevalently coded barrier for students. Other barriers and challenges cited by the interviewed learners included previous bad classroom experiences with the subject matter, inadequate background, and lack of resources such as money, infrastructure, and internet access. These results are enriched by illustrative quotes from interview transcripts and compared and contrasted with previous findings reported in the literature, and thus this study enhances the field by providing the voices of the learners.

Portraying animations of fingerspelling has proved surprisingly resistant to automation because of the collisions that arise from conventional interpolation of keyframes of individual manual letters. Previous methods have not been able to provide convincingly realistic fingerspelling due to the absence of effective collision avoidance in the underlying animation algorithms. This paper reports on the development and evaluation of a new collision avoidance algorithm that aids fingerspelling. Instead of analyzing letter transitions, the algorithm capitalizes on the transitions of individual fingers. The new strategy is efficient enough to support real-time fingerspelling while still maintaining a high level of predictive accuracy.

Graduate students enrolled in one of two sections of a hybrid seminar participated in synchronous online chats as a regular part of class. Conceptualizing learning as a process that reflects psychological change and humor as a social phenomenon that can support psychological well-being, transcripts were analyzed and coded for learning and humor. Analyses revealed that although a single comment was rarely coded for both learning and humor, these two constructs reflect an intermingling relationship throughout the socially-shared and co-created text of the online discussion. These findings contribute to our understanding of how students engaged in a computer-mediated discussion navigate the cognitive and social demands of the online context.;"[Vogler, Jane S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Educ Fdn Leadership & Aviat, 216 Willard Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Munsell, Sonya E.] Rogers State Univ, Dept Psychol & Sociol, Claremore, OK USA; [Knutson, Douglas] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA";"Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University";Vogler, JS (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Educ Fdn Leadership & Aviat, 216 Willard Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.;"jane.vogler@okstate.edu; smunsell@rsu.edu; douglas.knutson@siu.edu";Knutson, Douglas/W-5032-2019;"Knutson, Douglas/0000-0002-4905-4769; Vogler, Jane/0000-0001-6485-8522";;;;;55;5;5;2;11;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Conformal prediction (a.k.a. conformal inference) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed to provide the reader a working understanding of conformal prediction and related distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques with one self-contained document. We lead the reader through practical theory for and examples of conformal prediction and describe its extensions to complex machine learning tasks involving structured outputs, distribution shift, time-series, outliers, models that abstain, and more.

For the practice of English reading, a proper integration of learner portfolios and local environments, along with a sound reading strategy, not only strengthens the students' understanding of language and reading comprehension, but also improves the effectiveness of language learning. Extended from the methodology of situational language, this study,developed a ubiquitous English reading learning system based on RFID-based location-aware technology and a portfolio-centric article reading guide. Through RFID technology, the learning system can detect a learner's location; it then sends the learner highly situational and relevant English articles to read and study. Linking to the local environment, the English content becomes more perceivable, helping students achieve situational learning: what is seen is read. Concurrent with the mechanism for situated reading articles, this work conducted an analysis of learner study portfolios incorporating the average learner ability to obtain parameters of standing point. Using the genetic algorithm approach, the system evaluates the difficulty of articles and their relationships. Through multiple evolutionary sequences, the system eventually provides the learner with appropriate and progressive articles for personalized study. The experiment conducted in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations revealed that this learning system can effectively assist learners as they immerse themselves in the study.

Applications such as Scratch have been demonstrated to be effective in educational environments. The aim of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The Computational concepts and computational practices dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The Learning processes and coding in primary education dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.

Capturing the intended program behavior explicitly via contracts is thus an attractive proposition. In our recent work, we had espoused the notion of change contracts to express the intended program behavior changes across program versions. Change contracts differ from program contracts in that they do not require the programmer to describe the intended behavior of those program features which are unchanged across program versions. In this work, we present the formal semantics of our change contract language built on top of the Java modeling language (JML). Our change contract language can describe behavioral as well as structural changes. We evaluate the expressivity of the change contract language via a survey given to final-year undergraduate students. The survey results enable to understand the usability of our change contract language for purposes of writing contracts, comprehending written contracts, and modifying programs according to given change contracts. Finally, we develop both dynamic and static checkers for change contracts, and show how they can be used in maintaining software changes. We use our dynamic checker to automatically suggest tests that manifest violations of change contracts. Meanwhile, we use our static checker to verify that a program is changed as specified in its change contract. Apart from verification, our static checker also performs various other software engineering tasks, such as localizing the buggy method, detecting/debugging regression errors, and classifying the cause for a test failure as either error in production code or error in test code.;"[Yi, Jooyong; Qi, Dawei; Tan, Shin Hwei; Roychoudhury, Abhik] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117417, Singapore";National University of Singapore;Roychoudhury, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Comp 1,13 Comp Dr, Singapore 117417, Singapore.;abhik@comp.nus.edu.sg;Yi, Jooyong/ACE-0654-2022;"Yi, Jooyong/0000-0002-7215-0855; ROYCHOUDHURY, Abhik/0000-0002-7127-1137";NSF [ACI-1314674, CNS1228930];NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF));We thank David Cok (supported by NSF grants ACI-1314674, CNS1228930) for helping us use OpenJML and jSMTLIB.;;39;5;8;0;4;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1049-331X;1557-7392;;ACM T SOFTW ENG METH;ACM Trans.

For such scope, the Open Application Programming Interface from SAP 2000 software is linked to the Visual Basic for Application (VBA) environment embedded within Excel. Three computer applications resembling industrial situations related to size optimization of trusses, soil-structure interaction in buildings, and automatic design of reinforced concrete slabs are presented. As the tools are parameterized, students can observe the effects of the various parameters on the output response of the structures because geometry, loading, and material properties can be easily varied. As the main concern is the educational aspect, the novelty of this research is to present the proposed combined approach in a stepwise manner with explained codes. The source codes of the developed tools are made freely available so that the applicants can modify them according to their priorities. The tools present a friendly user interface that made them attractive to use in daily design tasks at the office, but certainly, they are the result of the integration of student knowledge as part of a bachelor's dissertation in an undergraduate civil engineering educational program. The tools have been preliminarily introduced into a reinforced concrete course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), searching for a better understanding of theoretical concepts, while integrating technology into the classroom and reducing time constraints as new configurations for the studied structures can be easily explored during class.;"[Tamayo, Jorge L.

To address message scarcity, some work is proposed for automatically generating commit messages. However, most of these approaches focus on generating summary of the changed software entities at the superficial level, without considering the intent behind the code changes (e.g., the existing approaches cannot generate such message: fixing null pointer exception). Considering developers often describe the intent behind the code change when writing the messages, we propose ChangeDoc, an approach to reuse existing messages in version control systems for automatical commit message generation. Our approach includes syntax, semantic, pre-syntax, and pre-semantic similarities. For a given commit without messages, it is able to discover its most similar past commit from a large commit repository, and recommend its message as the message of the given commit. Our repository contains half a million commits that were collected from SourceForge. We evaluate our approach on the commits from 10 projects. The results show that 21.5% of the recommended messages by ChangeDoc can be directly used without modification, and 62.8% require minor modifications. In order to evaluate the quality of the commit messages recommended by ChangeDoc, we performed two empirical studies involving a total of 40 participants (10 professional developers and 30 students). The results indicate that the recommended messages are very good approximations of the ones written by developers and often include important intent information that is not included in the messages generated by other tools.;"[Huang, Yuan; Zhou, Hao-Jie; Zheng, Zi-Bin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Natl Engn Res Ctr Digital Life, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Jia, Nan] Hebei GEO Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Shijiazhuang 050031, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiang-Ping] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Commun & Design, Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Simulat Publ Op, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ming-Dong] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ming-Dong] Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China";"Sun Yat Sen University; Hebei GEO University; Sun Yat Sen University; Guangdong University of Foreign Studies";Chen, XP (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Commun & Design, Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Simulat Publ Op, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;"huangyjn@gmail.com; jianan_0101@163.com; zhouhj8@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; chenxp8@mail.sysu.edu.cn; zhzibin@mail.sysu.edu.cn; mdtang@gdufs.edu.cn";Zheng, Zibin/E-3024-2014;Zheng, Zibin/0000-0002-7878-4330;"Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China [2020B010164002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61902441, 61722214, 61976061]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640855]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [20wkpy06, 20lgpy129]; Opening Project of Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing [202003]";"Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Opening Project of Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing";This work was (partially) supported by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province of China under Grant No. 2020B010164002, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 61902441, 61722214 and 61976061, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant No. 2018M640855, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China under Grant Nos. 20wkpy06 and 20lgpy129, and the Opening Project of Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing under Grant No. 202003.;;57;14;14;0;14;SCIENCE PRESS;BEIJING;16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA;1000-9000;1860-4749;;J COMPUT SCI TECH-CH;J.

Discovering better ways to teach programming and improving existing ones is essential to increase its accessibility. At present, most teaching approaches focus on high-level languages and constructs to ease understanding. However, understanding problems seem to persist making the learning process slow and painful. Moreover, mental models developed by students present gaps and misunderstandings that limit their maximum achievable abilities. This paper presents a new approach to teach students bottom-up, starting from machine code and assembler programming. This approach has been tested on first-year university students for two consecutive years. Experimental groups attended a 16 h course the week before their first term at the university.

In the study, a multimedia-based English programme comprising fifteen different units was delivered online as a one-semester instructional course. Ninety-eight undergraduate students participated, and they were divided into two groups: the treatment group used reflective learning e-journals, while the control group completed content-related exercises. The study investigated the effects of reflective learning e-journals and how students used them to aid learning. Results show that when learning from web-based instruction, students who used reflective learning e-journals outperformed students who did not do so in terms of reading comprehension. Using reflective e-journals improved the academic performance of learners in the online course. In addition, journal writing students claimed that they also improved their organisational skills and writing abilities through their reflective learning e-journal writing and found the journal writing to be a very helpful tool in reviewing the course and preparing for the exam.

Although virtual laboratories have drawn increasing research attention in the last decade, wiring practice, which is a crucial part of experimentation, is normally neglected. In this paper, a practice including 3-D modeling, HTML5-based rendering, and control algorithm design is implemented for the interactive virtual wiring based on the Networked Control System Laboratory (NCSLab) framework. The wiring practice is combined with control algorithm design, which is already realized in NCSLab, where users are allowed to customize algorithms using MATLAB/Simulink real-time workshop. Apart from remotely implementing the control algorithm, the 3-D virtual wiring process must be completed correctly before the online experiments can proceed properly. The proposed wiring laboratory is evaluated in practical teaching, with both students' performance and perception considered. The conclusions derived from the report show that the 3-D virtual wiring interactions make virtual experimentation complete for simulating a real case, as well as providing an opportunity for a clearer comprehension of control systems.;"[Lei, Zhongcheng; Zhou, Hong; Hu, Wenshan; Deng, Qijun; Zhou, Dongguo] Wuhan Univ, Dept Automat, Sch Power & Mech Engn, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhi-Wei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Automat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China";"Wuhan University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology";Hu, WS (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Dept Automat, Sch Power & Mech Engn, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.;"zhongcheng.lei@whu.edu.cn; hzhouwuhee@whu.edu.cn; wenshan.hu@whu.edu.cn; dqj@whu.edu.cn; dgzhou1985@whu.edu.cn; zwliu@sina.com";"Lei, Zhongcheng/AFD-1166-2022; Liu, Zhi-Wei/ABF-1175-2021";"Liu, Zhi-Wei/0000-0003-3005-1792; Hu, Wenshan/0000-0002-1341-5921";National Natural Science Foundation of China [61374064, 61673303];National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61374064 and Grant 61673303.;;48;31;31;1;31;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1551-3203;1941-0050;;IEEE T IND INFORM;IEEE Trans.

While researchers have been devising a number of methods to deal with vulnerabilities, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge on their software engineering life cycle, for example how vulnerabilities are introduced and removed by developers. This information can be exploited to design more effective methods for vulnerability prevention and detection, as well as to understand the granularity at which these methods should aim. To investigate the life cycle of known software vulnerabilities, we focus on how, when, and under which circumstances the contributions to the introduction of vulnerabilities in software projects are made, as well as how long, and how they are removed. We consider 3,663 vulnerabilities with public patches from the National Vulnerability Database-pertaining to 1,096 open-source software projects on GitHub-and define an eight-step process involving both automated parts (e.g., using a procedure based on the SZZ algorithm to find the vulnerability-contributing commits) and manual analyses (e.g., how vulnerabilities were fixed). The investigated vulnerabilities can be classified in 144 categories, take on average at least 4 contributing commits before being introduced, and half of them remain unfixed for at least more than one year. Most of the contributions are done by developers with high workload, often when doing maintenance activities, and removed mostly with the addition of new source code aiming at implementing further checks on inputs. We conclude by distilling practical implications on how vulnerability detectors should work to assist developers in timely identifying these issues.;"[Iannone, Emanuele; Guadagni, Roberta; Ferrucci, Filomena; De Lucia, Andrea; Palomba, Fabio] Univ Salerno, Software Engn SeSa Lab, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy";University of Salerno;Iannone, E (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Software Engn SeSa Lab, I-84084 Fisciano, Italy.;"r.guadagni1@studenti.unisa.it; eiannone@unisa.it; fferrucci@unisa.it; adelucia@unisa.it; fpalomba@unisa.it";Iannone, Emanuele/ABK-1299-2022;"Iannone, Emanuele/0000-0001-7489-9969; Palomba, Fabio/0000-0001-9337-5116; De Lucia, Andrea/0000-0002-4238-1425; FERRUCCI, Filomena/0000-0002-0975-8972";"Swiss National Science Foundation - SNF [PZ00P2_186090]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [PZ00P2_186090] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)";"Swiss National Science Foundation - SNF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))";The work of Fabio Palomba was supported in part by Swiss National ScienceFoundation - SNF Project under Grant PZ00P2_186090 (TED).;;108;17;17;0;5;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;0098-5589;1939-3520;;IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG;IEEE Trans.

Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm, which can solve linear system problems with exponential speed-up over the classical method and is the basis of many important quantum computing algorithms, is used to serve this purpose. The HHL algorithm is explained analytically followed by a 4-qubit numerical example in bra-ket notation. Matlab code corresponding to the numerical example is available for students to gain a deeper understanding of the HHL algorithm from a pure matrix point of view. A quantum circuit programmed using qiskit is also provided for real hardware execution in IBM quantum computers. After going through the material, students are expected to have a better appreciation of the concepts such as basis transformation, bra-ket and matrix representations, superposition, entanglement, controlled operations, measurement, quantum Fourier transformation, quantum phase estimation, and quantum programming.

The derived associations were used in the grouping process. Furthermore, the learning portfolio was used for assessing article correlation, article difficulty, and learner ability, and a dynamic and real-time personalized article recommendation mechanism is subsequently provided in the proposed e-book system.

As an effective tactic, conjugate gradient (CG) has been gaining its popularity in accelerating SO algorithms. This paper develops a novel type of stochastic conjugate gradient descent (SCG) algorithms from the perspective of the Powerball strategy and the hypergradient descent (HD) technique. The crucial idea behind the resulting methods is inspired by pursuing the equilibrium of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We elucidate the effect of the Powerball strategy in SCG algorithms. The introduction of HD, on the other side, makes the resulting methods work with an online learning rate. Meanwhile, we provide a comprehension of the theoretical results for the resulting algorithms under non-convex assumptions. As a byproduct, we bridge the gap between the learning rate and powered stochastic optimization (PSO) algorithms, which is still an open problem. Resorting to numerical experiments on numerous benchmark datasets, we test the parameter sensitivity of the proposed methods and demonstrate the superior performance of our new algorithms over state-of-the-art algorithms.;[Yang, Zhuang] Soochow Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China;Soochow University - China;Yang, Z (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China.;zhuangyng@163.com;杨, 壮/ABG-9921-2020;杨, 壮/0000-0002-8374-2928;;;;;51;1;1;9;10;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2332-7790;;;IEEE T BIG DATA;IEEE Trans.

J;Geng, YM;;;;Geng, Yanmei;;;Design of English teaching speech recognition system based on LSTM network and feature extraction;SOFT COMPUTING;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"LSTM network; Extract features; English teaching; Speech recognition system";;The development of educational informatization has had a profound impact on college English education. In order to better meet the needs of students, many universities have begun to explore new English education models. This paper designs a speech recognition system for English teaching based on LSTM network and feature extraction. LSTM network is used to process speech signals, extract speech features and then classify them. Feature extraction can transform speech signal into feature vector which can be used by classifier. Using a speech data set containing multiple English pronunciation words, the data set was tested and evaluated. The experimental results show that the speech recognition system based on LSTM network can effectively recognize the differences between different words and can achieve a higher classification accuracy under different noise and interference conditions. The English teaching speech recognition system based on LSTM network and feature extraction has great application prospects. By using the speech recognition system, teachers can evaluate students' English pronunciation level more efficiently and provide personalized teaching programs for students. At the same time, students can also practice English pronunciation independently through the speech recognition system to improve their language expression ability and listening comprehension.;"[Geng, Yanmei] Tianjin Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yanmei] Tianjin Univ, Sch Educ, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China";"Tianjin University; Tianjin University";"Geng, YM (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.;Geng, YM (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Educ, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.";lindagym@tju.edu.cn;;;National Social Science Fund of China [2020HB-0006];National Social Science Fund of China;The research is supported by the National Social Science Fund of China, Project name: Ancient Chinese Characters (EnglishVersion) within the Chinese Academic Translation Project category,Project No. 2020HB-0006;;14;1;1;5;15;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;2023 JUN 5;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00500-023-08550-w;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-023-08550-w;;JUN 2023;11;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;I1YF1;;Green Submitted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001000802400027;View Full Record in Web of Science

Many educational institutions now acknowledge Bloom's taxonomy-based students' cognitive levels evaluating subject-related learning. Therefore, in this paper, a novel optimized Examination Question Classification framework, referred to as QC-DcCapsGAN-AOSA, is proposed by combining the Dual-channel Capsule generative Adversarial Network (DcCapsGAN) with Atomic Orbital Search Algorithm (AOSA) for preprocessing a real-time online dataset of university examination questions, thus identify the key features from the raw data using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and finally classifying the examination questions. Atomic Orbital Search Algorithm is used to fine-tune the parameters' weights of the DcCapsGAN, and then uses these weights to categorize questions as Knowledge Level, Comprehension Level, Application Level, Analysis Level, Synthesis Level, and Evaluation Level. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method (QC-DcCapsGAN-AOSA) when compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as QC-LSTM-CNN and QC-BiGRU-CNN with an accuracy improvement of 23.65% and 29.04%, respectively.;"[Revanesh, M.; Rudra, Bhawana; Guddeti, Ram Mohana Reddy] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka NITK, IT Dept, Surathkal, Mangalore 575025, India";"National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka";Revanesh, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Karnataka NITK, IT Dept, Surathkal, Mangalore 575025, India.;revaneshm@gmail.com;rudra, bhawana/C-5384-2015;"Guddeti, Ram Mohana Reddy/0000-0003-1361-3837; Mayigaiah, Revanesh/0000-0002-6945-8656";National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal;National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal;This work was supported by the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal.;;58;3;3;2;7;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;75736;75747;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3296911;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3296911;;;12;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";O0HH5;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001040713100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To better understand why female students sometimes perform poorly in this discipline, this qualitative study aims to obtain the views of female computer programming teachers at a Saudi university on using mobile learning (m-learning) methods in computer programming lectures. Ten teachers from the all-female Aljouf University were interviewed to assess their perceptions of m-learning, in particular, the usefulness of ViLLE visualisation software.

This is the use of AR to provide product assembly instructions to factory workers. AR guided assembly has shown to outperform conventional (paper based) and virtual based methods of instruction delivery in terms of accuracy and time. However, authoring the AR content displayed to the worker is difficult and time consuming. The main challenge for an AR authoring tool is to allow the author the ability to register the content intuitively without having to understand complicated AR concepts. Many authoring tools have tried to overcome this challenge but have been unable to sufficiently create a good working abstraction for the novice author. The work presented in this paper focused on creating AR work instructions for bench top assemblies using a novel form of authoring termed expert demonstration. The working concept is that an expert is recorded performing the assembly steps by a computer vision system. The recording is then automatically processed to generate AR work instructions. Augmented Reality via Expert Demonstration Authoring (AREDA) is the name of the representative software developed in this research. AREDA is divided into two phases: the demonstration phase and refinement phase. Using computer vision algorithms along with a novel skin detection algorithm known as Particle Swarm Optimized Gaussian Mixture Model, the demonstration phase was created. This phase takes 3D point clouds of assembly sequences and converts them into ordered 3D parts along with their transformations. The refinement phase then allows a user to modify the automatically generated AR work instructions to fix errors and add useful virtual content (textual instructions). Finally, three use cases are presented using AREDA to generate the work instructions. Through these use cases, this paper shows the significance of the expert demonstration authoring approach.

However, matrices similar to node-link diagrams are most effective if their layout reveals the underlying data topology. Given the many developed algorithms, a practical problem arises: Which matrix reordering algorithm should I choose for my dataset at hand? To make matters worse, different reordering algorithms applied to the same dataset may let significantly different visual matrix patterns emerge. This leads to the question of trustworthiness and explainability of these fully automated, often heuristic, black-box processes. We present, a Visual Analytics system that helps novices, network analysts, and algorithm designers to open the black-box. Users can investigate the usefulness and expressiveness of 70 accessible matrix reordering algorithms. For network analysts, we introduce a novel model space representation and two interaction techniques for a user-guided reordering of rows or columns, and especially groups thereof (submatrix reordering). These novel techniques contribute to the understanding of the global and local dataset topology. We support algorithm designers by giving them access to 16 reordering quality metrics and visual exploration means for comparing reordering implementations on a row/column permutation level. We evaluated in a guided explorative user study with 12 subjects, a case study demonstrating its usefulness in a real-world scenario, and through an expert study gathering feedback on our design decisions. We found that our proposed methods help even inexperienced users to understand matrix patterns and allow a user-guided steering of reordering algorithms. helps to increase the transparency of matrix reordering algorithms, thus helping a broad range of users to get a better insight into the complex reordering process, in turn supporting data and reordering algorithm insights.;"[Behrisch, Michael; Pfister, Hanspeter] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schreck, Tobias] Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria";"Harvard University; Graz University of Technology";Behrisch, M (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;"behrisch@seas.harvard.edu; tobias.schreck@cgv.tugraz.at; pfister@seas.harvard.edu";;Pfister, Hanspeter/0000-0002-3620-2582;;;;;83;14;15;0;6;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1077-2626;1941-0506;;IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR;IEEE Trans.

This is evidenced by the rise of efforts both from the academia and the industry to reduce the energy consumption of those systems. Unlike hardware solutions, software initiatives targeting HPC systems' energy consumption reduction despite their effectiveness are often limited for reasons including (1) the program specific nature of the solution proposed; (2) the need of deep understanding of the application task at hand; and (3) proposed solutions are often difficult to use by novices and/or are designed for single task environments. This paper proposes a three step blind system-wide, application independent, fine-grain, and easy to use (user friendly) methodology for improving energy performance of HPC systems. The methodology typically breaks into phase detection, phase characterization, and phase identification and system reconfiguration. And it is blind in the sense that it does not require any knowledge from users. It relies upon reconfigurable capabilities offered by the majority of HPC subsystems-including the processor, storage, memory, and communication subsystems-to reduce the overall energy consumption of the system (excluding network equipments) at runtime. We also present an implementation of our methodology through which we demonstrate its effectiveness via static analyses and experiments using benchmarks representative of HPC workloads. The memory becoming one of the most power hungry HPC system this paper also introduces and investigates the relevance of a potential power saving scheme which we refer to as memory size scaling. It is destined to scale the memory size for saving energy in a CPU frequency scaling like fashion.

Since the idea of the Semantic Web was introduced in the late 1990's, many tools and applications that can be used on the Semantic Web have been developed and many people agree that it is relatively an ordered environment in which information units are hyperlinked according to their semantic relationships. On the other hand, there are still a group of users who do not even know the existence of the Semantic Web. The components of the Semantic Web include RDF (Resource Description Framework) documents, OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies, etc. and since the number of RDF documents has been increasing, it is not unusual that users encounter RDF documents while surfing the Web. In this paper, we propose an approach to introduce the Semantic Web to novice users. To this end, we have built an easy-to-use system that helps users create simple RDF documents and construct a small-scale Semantic Web like environment. Our system can take an input that a user provides and creates an RDF document and all that the user needs to do is define a string for the RDF document according to the grammar that we propose. Users can also define simple rules using the grammar and practice programming using RDF documents. We have experimented the proposed system with non-expert users who did not know the Semantic Web and experimental results indicated that they could have a concrete image about the Semantic Web even without knowing the technical details because they were able to create and modify RDF documents easily and they understood what is meant by representing information in a machine understandable way.;"[Jung, Hyosook; Yoo, Sujin; Kim, Doyeon; Park, Seongbin] Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci Educ, Seoul, South Korea";Korea University;Park, S (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci Educ, Seoul, South Korea.;hyperspace@korea.ac.kr;;Yoo, Sujin/0009-0000-5133-2468;College of Education, Korea University;College of Education, Korea University;This research was supported by the College of Education, Korea University Grant in 2013 and the corresponding author is Seongbin Park.;;28;2;2;0;20;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;1573-7721;;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

Nevertheless, existing graphic representations require a high level of abstraction that most beginner programmers cannot understand. Current state-of-the-art approaches provide promising alternatives, but a significant part leaves the advantages of graphic representation in the background. These advantages include abstracting the source code by means of symbols that make them easier to understand without previous training. This work introduces the evolution of a 2-D graphic notation to a 3-D environment, which represents an improvement to a complete platform for collaborative programming learning through problem solving, named COLLECE-2.0. This improvement provides the platform with capabilities to visualize programs through augmented reality by using a new set of graphic representations, which are based on roads and traffic signs in the context of programming learning. These visual models have been evaluated by Computer Science students to know whether the proposed notation is intuitive and useful. The obtained results show that the proposed notation is suitable for representing programming concepts and easy to understand. We also present a series of improvements, integrated as a new subsystem in the aforementioned platform, which allows the automatic construction of 3-D visualizations on an augmented reality environment.

It is estimated that understanding the source code accounts for 60% of the software maintenance effort. Cognitive informatics is important in quantifying the degree of difficulty or the efforts made by developers to understand the source code. Several empirical studies were conducted in 2003 to assign cognitive weights to each possible basic control structure of software, and these cognitive weights are used by several researchers to evaluate the cognitive complexity of software systems. In this paper, an effort has been made to categorize the Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nodes according to their node features. In our case, we extracted seven unique features from the program, and each unique feature was assigned an integer value that we evaluated through Cognitive Complexity Measures (CCMs). We then incorporated CCMs' results as a node feature value in CFGs and generated the same based on the node connectivity for a graph. In order to obtain the feature representation of the graph, a node vector matrix is then created for the graph and passed to the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We prepared our data sets using GCN output and then built Deep Neural Network Defect Prediction (DNN-DP) and Convolutional Neural Network Defect Prediction (CNN-DP) models to predict software defects. The Python programming language is used, along with Keras and TensorFlow. Three hundred twenty Python programs were written by our talented UG and PG students, and all experiments were carried out during laboratory classes.

Success in studying or conducting such a course is definitely a challenge. This paper proposes a systematic learning style recommendation. The model is designed to evaluate students' attributes and ongoing or formative learning outcomes for suggesting the effective style-fit strategy that facilitates learners to enhance their learning performances in terms of knowledge and skill. A two-stage association analysis was designed and conducted on a dataset collected from IT major students who enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Programming course. The first stage of association rules is to analyze and discover important relationships amongst learning styles, students' attribute, and learning performance. The second stage of moderation analysis is then applied to probe the moderation effect of the different learning preferences on the relationship between student attributes and learning achievement. Experiments expose many insights, for example, mathematics and logical thinking are powerful assets of success in computer programming study. Association rules can effectively identify associations of learning styles and the learning performance in terms of knowledge or skills. By moderation analysis, students in the Excellent cluster have a broad learning style than other students. Two types of significant moderators, the universal and specific, exemplify how lecturers can flexibly post style-fit teaching strategies for a class-wide and specific group, respectively.;"[Ninrutsirikun, Unhawa; Pal, Debajyoti; Arpnikanondtand, Chonlameth; Watanapa, Bunthit] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi Bangkok, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok, Thailand";King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi;Ninrutsirikun, U (corresponding author), King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi Bangkok, Sch Informat Technol, Bangkok, Thailand.;"unhawa@gmail.com; debajyoti.pal@sit.kmutt.ac.th; chonlameth@sit.kmutt.ac.th; bunthit@sit.kmutt.ac.th";Pal, Debajyoti/W-5408-2019;"Pal, Debajyoti/0000-0002-7305-1015; , Chonlameth/0000-0001-8062-1947; Ninrutsirikun, Unhawa/0000-0001-9196-1613; Watanapa, Bunthit/0000-0002-2086-3706";;;;;91;1;1;0;9;RIVER PUBLISHERS;GISTRUP;ALSBJERGVEJ 10, GISTRUP, 9260, DENMARK;1540-9589;1544-5976;;J WEB ENG;J.

In literature, proposed solutions to the problem focus on visualization-based artifacts, pedagogical methods, or a combination of both. The present study is framed within the cognitive learning paradigm and describes the design and testing of a linked list visualization software tool, based on the Split Attention effect of Cognitive Load Theory. The study was carried out at the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes (UAA), Mexico. In the learning effectiveness test, significant results (p = 0.000) are reported for the participants of the experimental group (n = 35), using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test, with a quasi-experimental pre-post test design. It is discussed that the spatial and temporal integration of linked list node diagrams and the corresponding worked example code for the implementation of its basic operations can benefit students with learning gaps in previous introductory programming courses. It is also reported that the control group (n = 36) had gains through traditional learning (p = 0.022), although this group started from a higher prior academic performance.

Learning the design of class diagrams is of paramount importance since these diagrams are used to guide concrete development tasks such as programming and testing, and, consequently, to avoid defective software products. Applying novel teaching/learning techniques in this topic may help students to reduce the defects that are committed at the moment of designing a class diagram. One interesting technique is the use of serious games, since they provide learning environments free of risks and pressure for students, allowing the students to know the topics that they must learn in a funny way. Serious games have been widely used in programming courses. We aim to investigate the feasibility to replicate this experience for conceptual modeling of class diagrams at Software Engineering courses. In this paper, we present a role-playing game especially focused on the class diagram, which is called Classutopia.

On the other hand, technology has been the most prevalent transition in the sport over the last century. Thanks to modern science, athletes can now go higher, run quicker, and, most importantly, remain healthy. Although academics, agencies, and policymakers had already urged physical education teachers to use technology in their classrooms, in many of these situations, technology is used for administrative purposes, including tracking enrolment and measuring, documenting, and reporting students' work. Thus, this paper suggests an intelligent Student Actions Evaluation System using Deep Learning (iSAES-DL)for student monitoring in physical education. This model uses the deep convolution neural network for the classification of risky actions. This model further evaluates the learners' degree of learning, retention, and achievements and suggests improvements and corrective measures. It highlights the benefits, uses, and limitations of applying deep learning techniques and IoT devices to develop learning analytics systems in the physical, educational domain. Eventually, output criteria such as comprehension, concentration, retention, and learner attainment are given a feature-by-feature analysis of the proposed methodology and traditional teaching-learning approaches.

Our first experiment investigates cheating behavior in a pair of online exams spanning 632 students in India. Our second experiment examines dishonest behavior on Mechanical Turk through an online task with 2,378 total participants. Using direct measurements that are not dependent on self-reports, we detect significant rates of cheating in both environments. We confirm that honor codes despite frequent use in massive open online courses (MOOCs) lead to only a small and insignificant reduction in online cheating behaviors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new intervention: a stern warning that spells out the potential consequences of cheating. We show that the warning leads to a significant (about twofold) reduction in cheating, consistent across experiments. We also characterize the demographic correlates of cheating on Mechanical Turk. Our findings advance the understanding of cheating in online environments, and suggest that replacing traditional honor codes with warnings could be a simple and effective way to deter cheating in online courses and online labor marketplaces.;"[Corrigan-Gibbs, Henry] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gupta, Nakull; Cutrell, Edward; Thies, William] Microsoft Res India, Bangalore 560001, Karnataka, India; [Northcutt, Curtis] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";"Stanford University; Microsoft; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)";Corrigan-Gibbs, H (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;;;;"NSF Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-114747]; NSDEG Fellowship; Catalyst Center for Sustainable Development at Microsoft Research India";"NSF Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSDEG Fellowship; Catalyst Center for Sustainable Development at Microsoft Research India(Microsoft)";An NSF Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-114747, an NSDEG Fellowship, and the Catalyst Center for Sustainable Development at Microsoft Research India provided financial support for this work.;;52;35;35;0;60;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1073-0516;1557-7325;;ACM T COMPUT-HUM INT;ACM Trans.

Two classes with a total of 65 11th-grade students participated. The classes were randomly assigned to either the experimental group learning the module with the epistemic scaffolds, or the control group learning the module without the scaffolds. Students' critiques of data visualizations in the pretests, during the online peer critique activity, and in the posttests were collected and analyzed. A coding scheme was generated for coding of epistemic criteria used in students' critiques. Epistemic network analysis was employed to reveal network models of students' epistemic criteria uses and changes. By comparing the experimental and control groups, and the pretests and posttests, the impact of the scaffolds and online peer critiquing was evidenced. Moreover, the results provide insights into the roles and relations among critiquing, scaffolding, and personal epistemology. Specifically, students' critiques of data visualizations may mainly focus on communicative criteria, which are secondary as opposed to primary criteria. After learning in the online peer critique activity with scaffolds, students' critiques involved more and diverse epistemic criteria including both primary and secondary criteria, indicating the development of epistemic understanding through online peer critiquing with scaffolds.;[Chang, Hsin-Yi] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Inst Res Excellence Learning Sci, Program Learning Sci, 162 Sec1, Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan;National Taiwan Normal University;Chang, HY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Inst Res Excellence Learning Sci, Program Learning Sci, 162 Sec1, Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;hychang@ntnu.edu.tw;;Chang, Hsin-Yi/0000-0002-9659-1022;"National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan [NSTC108-2628-H-003-001-MY3, NSTC111-2628-H-003-004-MY3]; Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan";"National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan; Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Institute for Research Excellence in Learning Sciences of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan";This work was supported by National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan, under Grants NSTC108-2628-H-003-001-MY3 and NSTC111-2628-H-003-004-MY3.

However, it is difficult to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games,first-person shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their controllers.;"[Yoon, Du-Mim; Kim, Kyung-Joong] Sejong Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul 143747, South Korea";Sejong University;Kim, KJ (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul 143747, South Korea.;kimkj@sejong.ac.kr;;Kim, Kyung Joong/0000-0002-7732-0817;National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP) [2013 R1A2A2A01016589];National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP);This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (2013 R1A2A2A01016589).;;27;18;19;8;88;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2015;3;;;;;;793;804;;10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2442680;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2442680;;;12;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";DF5JP;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000371388200060;View Full Record in Web of Science

Semantic versioning and impact of breaking changes in Maven Central An external and differentiated replication study;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Software evolution; API evolution; Breaking changes; Backwards compatibility; Maven Central";"API; DEVELOPERS; EVOLUTION";"Just like any software, libraries evolve to incorporate new features, bug fixes, security patches, and refactorings. However, when a library evolves, it may break the contract previously established with its clients by introducing Breaking Changes (BCs) in its API. These changes might trigger compile-time, link-time, or run-time errors in client code. As a result, clients may hesitate to upgrade their dependencies, raising security concerns and making future upgrades even more difficult. Understanding how libraries evolve helps client developers to know which changes to expect and where to expect them, and library developers to understand how they might impact their clients. In the most extensive study to date, Raemaekers et al. investigate to what extent developers of Java libraries hosted on the Maven Central Repository (MCR) follow semantic versioning conventions to signal the introduction of BCs and how these changes impact client projects. Their results suggest that BCs are widespread without regard for semantic versioning, with a significant impact on clients. In this paper, we conduct an external and differentiated replication study of their work. We identify and address some limitations of the original protocol and expand the analysis to a new corpus spanning seven more years of the MCR. We also present a novel static analysis tool for Java bytecode, Maracas, which provides us with: (i) the set of all BCs between two versions of a library, and; (ii) the set of locations in client code impacted by individual BCs. Our key findings, derived from the analysis of 119,879 library upgrades and 293,817 clients, contrast with the original study and show that 83.4% of these upgrades do comply with semantic versioning. Furthermore, we observe that the tendency to comply with semantic versioning has significantly increased over time. Finally, we find that most BCs affect code that is not used by any client, and that only 7.9% of all clients are affected by BCs. These findings should help (i) library developers to understand and anticipate the impact of their changes; (ii) library users to estimate library upgrading effort and to pick libraries that are less likely to break, and; (iii) researchers to better understand the dynamics of library-client co-evolution in Java.";"[Ochoa, Lina; Vinju, Jurgen] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Degueule, Thomas; Falleri, Jean-Remy] Univ Bordeaux, LaBRI, CNRS, Bordeaux INP, Bordeaux, France; [Falleri, Jean-Remy] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Vinju, Jurgen] Ctr Wiskunde, Informat, Amsterdam, Netherlands";"Eindhoven University of Technology; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Universitaire de France";Ochoa, L (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.;"l.m.ochoa.venegas@tue.nl; thomas.degueule@labri.fr; falleri@labri.fr; jurgen.vinju@cwi.nl";Degueule, Thomas/AEJ-3192-2022;Degueule, Thomas/0000-0002-5961-7940;European Union [732223];European Union(European Union (EU));This research has been carried out as part of the CROSSMINER project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 732223.

For example, practitioners using feature toggles can experiment with new features in a production environment by exposing them to a subset of users. Some of these toggles require additional maintainability efforts and are expected to be removed, whereas others are meant to remain for a long time. However, to date, very little is known about the removal of feature toggles, which is why we focus on this topic in our paper. We conduct an empirical study that focuses on the removal of feature toggles. We use source code analysis techniques to analyze 12 Python open source projects and surveyed 61 software practitioners to provide deeper insights on the topic. Our study shows that 75% of the toggle components in the studied Python projects are removed within 49 weeks after introduction. However, eventually practitioners remove feature toggles to follow the life cycle of a feature when it becomes stable in production. We also find that not all long-term feature toggles are designed to live that long and not all feature toggles are removed from the source code, opening the possibilities to unwanted risks. Our study broadens the understanding of feature toggles by identifying reasons for their survival in practice and aims to help practitioners make better decisions regarding the way they manage and remove feature toggles.;"[Hoyos, Juan; Bedoya, Albeiro Espinosa] Univ Nacl Colombia, Medellin, Colombia; [Abdalkareem, Rabe; Mujahid, Suhaib; Shihab, Emad] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Abdalkareem, Rabe] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada";"Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Concordia University - Canada; Queens University - Canada";Hoyos, J (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Medellin, Colombia.;"jdhoyosr@unal.edu.co; abdrabe@gmail.com; s_mujahi@encs.concordia.ca; eshihab@encs.concordia.ca; aespinos@unal.edu.co";"Abdalkareem, Rabe/AET-2496-2022; Abdalkareem, Rabe/IQV-8842-2023; Espinosa Bedoya, Albeiro/O-3341-2017";"Abdalkareem, Rabe/0000-0001-9914-5434; Espinosa Bedoya, Albeiro/0000-0001-7292-987X; Hoyos, Juan/0000-0003-4017-6126; Mujahid, Suhaib/0000-0003-2738-1387";;;;;31;0;0;0;3;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

These courses typically have a strong practical component where students learn the fundamentals of the computer architecture and the handling of input/output operations through the development of simple programs in a low-level assembly programming language. Since these practical sessions require a strong involvement, student attendance and withdrawal rates are poor, lowering academic results and introducing a negative feedback loop that preconditions students to dislike them. This article introduces a new methodology for the practical sessions of Computer Organization and Design courses. This methodology disavows the use of simulators and focuses on actual hardware to promote a feeling of proximity to the execution and outcome of the programs. The proposed setup uses Raspberry Pi devices to encourage students to work autonomously, due to their low cost, capability of running an OS, and rich ecosystem of simple hardware devices. The setup is completed with RISC OS, which combines a simple window-based graphical interface with a low-level management of the hardware without requiring software abstraction layers. The article presents the methodology and the UCDebug tool, developed to help students debug their codes in RISC OS. After the introduction of the new setup at the University of Cantabria, academic results and student satisfaction have improved. The setup has also allowed to sustain a similar organization of the courses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.;"[Fuentes, Pablo; Camarero, Cristobal; Herreros, David; Mateev, Vladimir; Vallejo, Fernando; Martinez, Carmen] Univ Cambria, Dept Ingn Informat & Elect, Santander 39005, Spain";Universidad de Cantabria;Fuentes, P (corresponding author), Univ Cambria, Dept Ingn Informat & Elect, Santander 39005, Spain.;"fuentesp@unican.es; camareroc@unican.es; david.herrerosc@alumnos.unican.es; vladimir-kirilov.mateev@alumnos.unican.es; vallejof@unican.es; martinezc@unican.es";Fuentes, Pablo/AAA-1883-2019;"Fuentes, Pablo/0000-0001-6424-2533; Mateev Mateev, Vladimir Kirilov/0000-0002-9943-6837";"Vicerrectorado de Ordenacion Academica y Profesorado de la Universidad de Cantabria; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity [TIN2016-76635C2-2-R]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PID2019-105660RB-C22]; Juan de la Cierva [FJCI-2017-31643]";"Vicerrectorado de Ordenacion Academica y Profesorado de la Universidad de Cantabria; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Juan de la Cierva(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government)";This work was supported in part by the Fourth and Fifth Editions of the Teaching Innovation Projects from the Vicerrectorado de Ordenacion Academica y Profesorado de la Universidad de Cantabria, in part by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity under Grant TIN2016-76635C2-2-R (AEI/FEDER, UE), in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under Grant PID2019-105660RB-C22, and in part by the Juan de la Cierva under Grant FJCI-2017-31643.;;45;0;0;0;6;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

The challenges faced in communicating in English in Chinese radio stations are majorly caused by the lack of language professionals and linguists in the broadcast stations. The absence of these professionals is a major constraint to the development of the community. The broadcast media can help manage multilingualism through the introduction of new words which would give little or no room for lexicon dearth but would expand the language lexicon. Using the English language during broadcast reduces language dearth, and helps reach a much larger audience, even those not in China. Programmes anchored in English in places where the language is barely spoken enhances the vocabulary, comprehension and language vitality of the listeners. This study examined the impact of the English language used in radio broadcasting using a descriptive Big Data survey research design. The study's population comprises of the inhabitants of the Hunan province in China, from which a sample of 50 broadcast staff and 150 regular inhabitants was drawn using a stratified random sampling technique. The instrument of data collection was a structured questionnaire with closed questions and a self-structured interview. The sample employed frequency distribution tables, percentages, and charts in the presentation and analysis of data. The results revealed that majority of the respondents in Hunan listened to radio broadcast indicating that the use of English language can have massive impact on the people. The study also found that majority of the respondents use their indigenous languages in their day-to-day activities as well as their schools with English being used majorly only in schools with only English-speaking students. The study recommends, amongst others, that the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) review their policy on the allocated time of broadcast in English languages, and that more English language experts and linguists should be incorporated into the broadcast system.;"[Zhang, Ruihua] Qiannan Normal Univ Nationalities, Sch Comp & Informat, Duyun 558000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruihua; Zhang, Shixue] Segi Univ, Fac Educ, Language & Psychol Postgrad Dept, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia; [Zhou, Jincheng; Hai, Tao] Qiannan Normal Univ Nationalities, Sch Comp & Informat, Qiannan Buyei 558000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jincheng; Hai, Tao] Qiannan Normal Univ Nationalities, Sch Comp & Informat, Miao Aut 558000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jincheng; Hai, Tao] Qiannan Normal Univ Nationalities, Key Lab Complex Syst & Intelligent Optimizat Guiz, Qiannan Buyei 558000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jincheng; Hai, Tao] Qiannan Normal Univ Nationalities, Key Lab Complex Syst & Intelligent Optimizat Guiz, Miao Aut 558000, Peoples R China; [Hai, Tao] Univ Teknol Malaysia UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Comp, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Zhang, Shixue] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Insititute Int Cooperat & Exchange, Baoji 721013, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Iwendi, Marvellous] Univ Nigeria, Enugu, Nigeria; [Shah, Mohd Asif] Kebri Dehar Univ, Kebri Dehar 250, Somali, Ethiopia; [Shah, Mohd Asif] Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Hyderabad 502345, Telangana, India; [Shah, Mohd Asif] Lovely Profess Univ, Div Res & Dev, Phagwara 144001, Punjab, India";"SEGi University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Baoji University of Arts & Sciences; University of Nigeria; Lovely Professional University";"Zhang, SX (corresponding author), Segi Univ, Fac Educ, Language & Psychol Postgrad Dept, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.;Zhang, SX (corresponding author), Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Insititute Int Cooperat & Exchange, Baoji 721013, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Shah, MA (corresponding author), Kebri Dehar Univ, Kebri Dehar 250, Somali, Ethiopia.;Shah, MA (corresponding author), Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Hyderabad 502345, Telangana, India.;Shah, MA (corresponding author), Lovely Profess Univ, Div Res & Dev, Phagwara 144001, Punjab, India.";"zhangshixue@bjwlxy.edu.cn; ohaasif@kdu.edu.et";"Osamor, Jude/AGQ-6699-2022; Osamor, Jude/IUO-5999-2023; HAI, TAO/D-9580-2011; Zhou, Jincheng/KIB-4330-2024; Shah, Mohd Asif/GOJ-7931-2022";"Zhou, Jincheng/0000-0002-1995-4002; Shah, Mohd Asif/0000-0002-0351-9559; HAI, TAO/0000-0002-6156-1974; Osamor, Jude/0000-0002-3739-8521";;;;;28;1;1;4;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;;2192-113X;;J CLOUD COMPUT-ADV S;J.

However, there is a relative paucity of solutions that cater to problems students face when learning programming that is mainly caused by the abstract nature of programming, misconceptions of programming concepts, and lack of motivation. Hence, in this study, a framework to address the abstract nature of programming and common programming misconceptions is developed. The framework consists of three modules that correspond to each issue, powered by a simulation engine. The first module is developed to address the abstract nature of programming by representing programming concepts with concrete objects in the virtual environment. The second module employs simulation techniques such as interactions and player perspectives to address common programming misconceptions. Lastly, the third module employs elements in the virtual environment to engage students when learning through the system. To evaluate the system, 60 participants were randomly divided into the control group (N = 30) and the experimental group (N = 30). Participants in the control group were taught using a video lecture while participants in the experimental group were taught using the developed VR intervention. Evaluation results gathered quantitatively indicated that the VR intervention was able to significantly increase programming concepts comprehension and address programming misconceptions. Participants also rated the developed VR intervention to be significantly more engaging than the video lecture.;"[Wee, Chyanna; Yap, Kian Meng; Lim, Woan Ning] Sunway Univ, Res Ctr Human Machine Collaborat HUMAC, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia";Sunway University;Wee, C (corresponding author), Sunway Univ, Res Ctr Human Machine Collaborat HUMAC, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Petaling Jaya 47500, Selangor, Malaysia.;15060197@imail.sunway.edu.my;Lim, Woan Ning/ABA-4535-2021;"Lim, Woan Ning/0000-0002-7512-4054; Wee, Chyanna/0000-0001-9093-3178; Yap, Kian Meng/0000-0001-6795-9847";Internal Research Grant Scheme (IRGS) [GRTIN-IRG-135-2021];Internal Research Grant Scheme (IRGS);This work was supported in part by the Internal Research Grant Scheme (IRGS) under Grant GRTIN-IRG-135-2021.;;121;3;3;1;22;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2022;10;;;;;;100054;100078;;10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204392;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204392;;;25;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";4Y1WX;;gold, Green Accepted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000861323700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Normalized assessment and prompt feedback enable a student to improve the articulation, comprehension and overall presentation of ideas. In this work, we present a system that can take in input as the images of the essay sheets and outputs the grade/score of the essay. We show a pipelined approach by combining a handwriting recognition model and automated essay scoring. Current handwriting recognition systems show an excellent transcription performance on the existing public domain dataset. These datasets are primarily captured in a constrained manner. The performance and efficacy of these models on unconstrained data are crucial for text understanding. In our work, we adapt an existing full-page handwriting recognition model to the unconstrained handwritten essay dataset. The full page handwriting recognition model is a deep learning model based on CNN and LSTM layers with explicit modules to identify the start of line, line normalization and text line recognition. The unconstrained dataset is from a national essay competition where students upload the essay after scanning the essay. This dataset is wild in nature as the background, margins, text-fonts and the scanning device make it challenging both visually and algorithmically.We have curated a subset of this dataset for all the experiments in this work and intend to make this dataset publicly available. We further analyze the performance on the downstream task of essay scoring using a set of classical handcrafted features and transformer-based contextual embeddings.We have formulated the problem of essay scoring as a regression task. The pre-trained embeddings/handcrafted features, for each essay, are used as representative features for the essay scoring model. Our results show that there is only a slight performance degradation in the essay scoring task due to transcription errors from the handwriting recognition module.

This article describes a five week program that employs active and problem-based learning activities to teach tech innovation and entrepreneurship to local teens in the Washington, DC, USA area. Called #WatchMeCode, the program's objective is to build black HS boys' confidence in coding, communicating their programming skills, and rebuilding their thoughts about computer science. The program uses a constructivist pedagogical approach allowing students to build their understanding of computer science and technology through Internet-search-based history lessons, podcasts, and presentations by other black male tech entrepreneurs. Additionally, students ventured out into their community with hands-on design-thinking and customer discovery skills to observe their environment, its issues/problems, and developed new technology with their unique perspectives in mind.

The specific focus of this work was on understanding how teachers used classroom dialogue to create an environment that supports the use of multiple online text-based resources as part of the process of doing science. Data collection for this study occurred in the 6th grade classrooms of two teachers in a Midwestern school district. Each of the teachers taught three science classes for a total of 150 students. A test of students' content knowledge of physics was used in order to evaluate students' understanding of the physics concepts targeted in the curriculum. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that the students from one teacher's classes performed significantly better on the physics test than the students of the other teacher (p<.05). To qualitatively investigate the differences between the whole class dialogue used by the two teachers, teachers' interactions with students as they prepared them to engage in research with the multiple texts were coded. Coding of the dialogue revealed that the teacher whose students exhibited higher learning outcomes engaged in more deep level facilitation strategies during whole class discussion, including setting learning goals for text interactions, connecting to prior knowledge, and discussing the use of multiple texts as part of doing science.;"[Sullivan, Sarah] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, 600 Highland Ave,K6-126 CSC, Madison, WI 53792 USA; [Puntambekar, Sadhana] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Educ Psychol, Madison, WI 53706 USA";"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Sullivan, S (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, 600 Highland Ave,K6-126 CSC, Madison, WI 53792 USA.;"sullivans@surgery.wisc.edu; puntambekar@education.wisc.edu";;Jung, Sarah/0000-0001-8226-7566;"U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences [R305A080507]; U.S. National Science Foundation Education Core Research Program [DRL-1431904]";"U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences(US Department of Education); U.S. National Science Foundation Education Core Research Program";This work is supported in part by U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, Grant No. R305A080507 and the U.S. National Science Foundation Education Core Research Program, Grant No. DRL-1431904.

Yet, adoption of these techniques for data visualization is low partly because development is difficult: existing collaboration software systems either do not support simultaneous interaction or require expensive redevelopment of existing visualizations. We contribute VisConnect: a web-based synchronous distributed collaborative visualization system that supports most web-based SVG data visualizations, balances system safety with responsiveness, and supports simultaneous interaction from many collaborators. VisConnect works with existing visualization implementations with little-to-no code changes by synchronizing low-level JavaScript events across clients such that visualization updates proceed transparently across clients. This is accomplished via a peer-to-peer system that establishes consensus among clients on the per-element sequence of events, and uses a lock service to grant access over elements to clients. We contribute collaborative extensions of traditional visualization interaction techniques, such as drag, brush, and lasso, and discuss different strategies for collaborative visualization interactions. To demonstrate the utility of VisConnect, we present novel examples of collaborative visualizations in the healthcare domain, remote collaboration with annotation, and show in an education case study for e-learning with 22 participants that students found the ability to remotely collaborate on class activities helpful and enjoyable for understanding concepts.

The workshop includes basic concepts related to hardware (Time domain reflectometry [TDR] probe, Arduino UNO, and Water flow measurement) and software (LabVIEW and Android studio programming platforms) followed by project implementation in a group of 5-6 students. Satisfaction and comprehension were found to increase significantly for subjects (electronics and optics) to students of civil engineering background. The adopted tools represent economical means for application in conventional classrooms as well as laboratories for undergraduate students with a civil engineering background. This integration of the digital and physical world is an attempt at approaching soil mechanics mathematics from technology and arts from a scientific perspective.

This negative perception is the result of many factors such as restricted access to lab facilities, lack of allocated time to these labs, and the complexity of the subject itself. One main factor that influences this viewpoint is the difficulty of grasping 3D orientation of sectioned tissues, especially regarding embryology. Attempts have been made previously to create alternative teaching methods to help alleviate these issues, but few have explored 3D visualisation. We aimed to address these issues by creating 3D embryological reconstructions from serial histology sections of a sheep embryo. These were deployed in a mobile application that allowed the user to explore the original sections in sequence, alongside the counterpart 3D model. The application was tested against a currently available eHistology programme on a cohort of life sciences graduates (n = 14) through qualitative surveys and quantitative testing through labelling and orientation-based tests. The results suggest that using a 3D modality such as the one described here significantly improves student comprehension of orientation of slides compared to current methods (p = 0.042). Furthermore, the developed application was deemed more interesting, useful, and usable than current eHistology tools (p < 0.05). Modalities such as that developed here could therefore provide a more effective approach to learning these challenging subjects potentially increasing student engagement with embryology and histology.;"[Tait, Keiran; Poyade, Matthieu] Glasgow Sch Art, Sch Simulat & Visualisat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Tait, Keiran; Clancy, Jennifer A.] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Anat Facil, Sch Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland";"Glasgow School of Art; University of Glasgow";Clancy, JA (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Anat Facil, Sch Life Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Jenny.Clancy@glasgow.ac.uk;"Tait, Keiran/ISA-5433-2023; Clancy, Jennifer Ann/GMW-5653-2022";"Clancy, Jennifer Ann/0000-0002-1568-2046; Poyade, Matthieu/0000-0002-7229-949X";;;;;39;4;4;2;4;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0065-2598;2214-8019;"978-3-030-43961-3; 978-3-030-43960-6";ADV EXP MED BIOL;Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.;;2020;1262;;;;;;19;38;;10.1007/978-3-030-43961-3_2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43961-3_2;10.1007/978-3-030-43961-3;;20;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Biomedical";"Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Engineering";BP5KS;32613578;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000556128700003;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Ji, Q;;;;Ji, Qiong;;;Readability Evaluation of Books in Chinese as a Foreign Language Using the Machine Learning Algorithm;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;TEXT;The arrival of the boom of teaching Chinese as a foreign language (TCFL) and personalized learning has led to a sharp increase in the demand for the Chinese language reading material. There are numerous reading materials available in Chinese for foreign students and learners to read and evaluate. The high-quality TCFL reading materials with reasonable arrangement can provide convenience for learners with diSerent reading comprehension, interpretation abilities, and levels to master a language more quickly. Therefore, this study carries out an automatic readability assessment of books in Chinese as a foreign language. This paper comprehensively considers the factors aSecting the difficulty of reading materials from the perspective of Chinese ontology based on the existing readability assessment research. Using natural language processing and a database management system to extract the features of books in Chinese as a foreign language, the text readability is evaluated with a statistical machine learning algorithm. The model is optimized by feature selection and sorting feature selection technology. The packaging feature selection technology is introduced to optimize the algorithm performance. The feature sets and each independent feature in the three dimensions of word meaning, part of speech, and discourse were optimized by the machine learning regression model based on certain evaluation indexes. Moreover, this work examined that the regression model is eSective at identifying and recommending simpler textbooks for learning with difficult foreign language materials. For high-proficient learners, this approach signi`cantly improves performance and measurement efficiency of reading books.;[Ji, Qiong] Ji Lin Univ, Coll Humanities, Changchun, Peoples R China;Jilin University;Ji, Q (corresponding author), Ji Lin Univ, Coll Humanities, Changchun, Peoples R China.;jiqiong15@mails.jlu.edu.cn;;;;;;;33;0;0;11;35;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

In this study, we explore the correlation between text complexity and reading comprehension through the lens of neuroinformatics. Our objective is to ascertain whether it is feasible to infer the difficulty level of a text for a learner based on their brain activity, quantified by an electroencephalogram (EEG), during the information retrieval process. To accomplish this, we administered a section of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test to our participants, evaluating their average reading fluency. Subsequently, the 18 participants under observation read paragraphs of varying complexity and responded to questions pertaining to the text. Utilizing the amassed data, we trained a deep learning model known as EEGNet to autonomously discern the complexity of the text being read, relying on the EEG signals. Furthermore, we conducted a comparison with previous research that employed a distinct characterization approach and employed a random forest algorithm for classification. The outcomes revealed that the present approach (EEGNet) outperformed the former method, achieving an accuracy rate of 80.83% across all subjects, whereas the random forest algorithm achieved a mere 50.28% accuracy. Our findings suggest the potential to classify the EEG signals in accordance with the level of difficulty a student encounters when comprehending the text. We propose several avenues for extending our work into real-time scenarios.;"[Torres-Garcia, Alejandro A.] Inst Nacl Astrofis Opt & Electr, Biosignals Proc & Med Comp Lab, Luis Enrique Erro 1, Puebla 72840, Mexico; [Martinez-Santiago, Fernando; Montejo-Raez, Arturo; Urena-Lopez, L.

Despite many equations and methods recommended for estimating roughness coefficients, only two standard resistance equations (original Manning's and Keulegan's equations) have been widely taught and utilized in practice. There can be various reasons for not using new bed roughness predictors (BRPs), one of which is the absence of teaching BRPs. A rigorous analysis of available BRPs for estimating grain and form roughness coefficients delineates that most of them are comprised of a scheme rather than a single equation. Also, each BRP is tailored to solve a distinct type of problem; however, a proper definition of a problem statement helps shedding light on this application. This study presents an Excel VBA-based educational estimator to address the gap. For this purpose, the problem statement is first revisited to accomplish a better understanding in light of proper problem classification. On the basis of different groups of input and output data, each BRP is implemented into an Excel spreadsheet and VBA codes are presented for BRPs incorporating both grain and form roughness. This computer application can help students in open-channel engineering courses not only to become familiar with modified BRPs but also to acknowledge the merit of the Excel spreadsheet for estimating flow resistance coefficients. Finally, as the VBA codes are presented in detail, they can be modified by users in accordance with their priorities for both educational and practical purposes.";[Niazkar, Majid] Shiraz Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Shiraz, Iran;Shiraz University;Niazkar, M (corresponding author), Shiraz Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Zand Blvd, Shiraz 7134851156, Iran.;mniazkar@shirazu.ac.ir;Niazkar, Majid/I-1844-2019;Niazkar, Majid/0000-0002-5022-1026;;;;;34;8;8;2;11;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

In this study, engineering students enrolled in Computer-Aided Analysis and Design course were first introduced to FEM through a simple computer code for analyzing two-dimensional (2D) and 3D trusses. Computational tools called Truss Builder and Truss Analyzer were provided to help modeling and analyzing large and complicated trusses. Students were then asked to generate assignments for their peers on analyzing 2D and 3D trusses that simulate real-world structures or practical applications of their choice in two mini projects. In each mini project, each student selected a practical truss problem and, then, chose questions on this truss from a pool of questions designed to check the students' ability to navigate through the computer code, understand the results of the analysis, and investigate the effects of the various parameters on the results. Students exchanged their assignments with their peers, solved their peers' assignments, and then graded the solutions of their peers and discussed the mistakes. The proposed approach has been assessed through a comparison of exam scores with the scores of a previous cohort that was taught FEM traditionally and took the same exam. The assessment results showed that the improved performance of the students who were part of this intervention, compared to those who were not, is statistically significant. The anonymous students' written comments also supported the hypothesis that this new approach is more engaging to students compared to traditional approaches.;[Bishay, Peter L.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Mech Engn, Northridge, CA 91330 USA;"California State University System; California State University Northridge";Bishay, PL (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Mech Engn, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.;peter.bishay@csun.edu;Bishay, Peter L./X-8571-2018;Bishay, Peter L./0000-0002-1696-351X;Department of Mechanical Engineering at California State University, Northridge;Department of Mechanical Engineering at California State University, Northridge;The author acknowledges the support of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at California State University, Northridge.;;37;7;7;0;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Many of the underpinning assumptions have evolved over the past two decades in various directions, while the same nomenclature is employed-inevitably in ambiguous ways. This contribution seeks to elicit an organized understanding of what we talk about and when we talk about living lab studies in HCI. This is accomplished through the methods of discourse analysis [66, 69], a combination of coding, hypothesis generation, and inferential statistics on the coded data. Analysing the discursive context within which the term living laboratory (or lab) appears in 152 SIGCHI and TOCHI articles, we extracted five divergent strands with overlapping but distinct conceptual frameworks, labeled as Visited Places, Instrumented Places, Instrumented People, Lived-in Places, and Innovation Spaces. In the first part of this article, we describe in detail the method and outcome of our analysis that draws out the five strands. Building on the results of the first part, in the second part of this article, each of the five types of living lab is discussed using some of the prototypical examples of that kind presented in the literature. Finally, we discuss the raison d'etre and future position of the living lab as a method within HCI research and design and in relation to advances in sensing technologies and the emerging world of intelligent built environments (e.g., smart city and smart home).;"[Alavi, Hamed S.; Rogers, Yvonne] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St 66-72, London, England; [Lalanne, Denis] Univ Fribourg, Human IST Inst, Blvd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland";"University of London; University College London; University of Fribourg";Alavi, HS (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Comp Sci, Gower St 66-72, London, England.;"hamed.alavi@unifr.ch; denis.lalanne@unifr.ch; y.rogers@ucl.ac.uk";;Lalanne, Denis/0000-0001-7834-0417;;;;;71;16;16;0;15;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1073-0516;1557-7325;;ACM T COMPUT-HUM INT;ACM Trans.

As educators, we asked ourselves how to make students aware of that, and how to offer them a new and appealing approach to physics. We also wondered how to increase students' engagement, participation, and understanding, particularly when lessons are delivered online. Thus, we began a project to develop study materials for an introductory course in physics for computer science and we chose to use open source software. The materials are organized as a set of Jupyter notebooks hosted on an open GitHub repository. The notebooks deal with the fundamental concepts of physics related to everyday life, offering examples of what can be done with a few lines of Python code. In the notebooks we propose activities to observe phenomena, describe problems, experiment, acquire and analyze data, and model the behavior of systems. The contents are suitable for undergraduates, high-school students, and evergreen students. We have used the materials for lectures, guided laboratory activities, and presentations to freshmen and younger students, and we plan to continue with this project.;"[Mandanici, Andrea; Mandaglio, Giuseppe; Nibali, Valeria Conti; Fiumara, Giacomo] Univ Messina, Dipartimento MIFT, I-98766 Messina, Italy; [Pirrotta, Giovanni] Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy";"University of Messina; University of Messina";Mandanici, A (corresponding author), Univ Messina, Dipartimento MIFT, I-98766 Messina, Italy.;"andrea.mandanici@unime.it; giuseppe.mandaglio@unime.it; valeria.continibali1@unime.it; giacomo.fiumara@unime.it; giovanni.pirrotta@unime.it";"Nibali, Valeria Conti/L-1260-2016; Fiumara, Giacomo/AAF-2653-2019; Mandanici, Andrea/K-4349-2015; Mandaglio, Giuseppe/J-9025-2015";"Fiumara, Giacomo/0000-0003-1528-7203; Mandanici, Andrea/0000-0002-3238-4948; Pirrotta, Giovanni/0000-0002-2090-6841; Mandaglio, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4486-4807; Conti Nibali, Valeria/0000-0002-5269-7132";;;;;7;1;1;0;6;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1521-9615;1558-366X;;COMPUT SCI ENG;Comput.

We aimed to identify mechanisms that can affect the safety and effectiveness of these systems in hospital settings thus contributing to the building of an explicit and replicable understanding of the variables that can affect the functioning of IT systems. Materials and Methods: This qualitative study drew from observations and semistructured interviews from a purposive sample of 46 participants (26 emergency department and 20 laboratory and medical imaging staff) across 3 Australian hospitals. Iterative, inductive coding of the data led to the development of higher-level themes based on relationships between codes. Results: Two overarching themes emerged: (1) usability and safety of the electronic test result management system; and (2) system redesign considerations about who is meant to follow up, when and how. The usability and safety of digital systems and the way these systems deal with accountability processes are triggered by mechanisms that are contextually dependent. Discussion: Our findings highlighted the multitransactional nature of the test result management process involving numerous healthcare professionals across different settings. This communication requires integration of the systems utilized by different departments and transparency of the test result follow-up process to facilitate clear lines of responsibility and accountability.

The introduction of CT in primary mathematics curricula puts many demands on teachers, and their understanding of CT in mathematics is key to its successful introduction. Inspired by an information ecology perspective, we investigate how four primary school teachers understand CT in mathematics and how they go ahead to include CT in their mathematics teaching practice. Through observations and interviews, we find promising starting points for including CT, related to pattern recognition, problem solving and the use of programming activities. Our findings indicate that teachers' lack of knowledge affects CT adoption in two ways: during its inclusion in the existing mathematics curriculum and as a new element focussed on programming and coding, leaving mathematics in the background. For the inclusion to be fruitful, we suggest there is a need to help teachers understand how CT can be used productively in mathematics and vice versa.;"[Nordby, Siri Krogh; Bjerke, Annette Hessen; Mifsud, Louise] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Oslo, Norway";Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet);Nordby, SK (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Oslo, Norway.;"Siri-Krogh.Nordby@oslomet.no; Annette.Hessen@oslomet.no; Louise.Mifsud@oslomet.no";Bjerke, Annette Hessen/AAE-9150-2019;"Bjerke, Annette Hessen/0000-0002-2138-2891; Mifsud, Louise/0000-0002-8991-1067; Nordby, Siri Krogh/0000-0002-1429-7533";OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University;OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University;Open access funding provided by OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University.;;37;7;7;7;47;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0933-1875;1610-1987;;KUNSTL INTELL;Kunstl.

The language translation method engages language learners by placing them in effective learning environments. The purpose of English language conversion is primarily to teach non-native speakers' native languages by providing them with a simple and easy-to-understand vocabulary to introduce them to a new language. This study proposes a framework for collaborative privacy management in smart classroom networks based on fuzzy logic decision-making. We used the data sensitivity and confidence values as input variables for the fuzzy system in our framework. Our framework also incorporates trust values between users, because it calculates the trust loss and gain to determine the reputation value. This study investigated the development of an English translation learning system using big data analysis and IoT to enhance students' comprehension of the English language and improve their ability, effectiveness, and proficiency in translation. For this purpose, a client/server (C/S) learning system for English translation on Android devices is proposed. A detailed description is provided of the functionality of each module and database of the system, which is designed using a model-view-controller architecture. Moreover, the system utilizes a three-layer IoT architecture to facilitate wireless connections among Android devices, network translation servers, and speech synthesis servers, thereby providing users with intelligent services. Subsequently, the study applied an enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to analyze English translation learning data. In addition to filtering out irrelevant information from the original dataset, the relief algorithm produces index weights that can be used in the improved fuzzy c-means clustering procedure. The enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is combined with a threshold to create an objective function. Moreover, a unique insight into the English translation learning mode by classifying and clustering English translation resource data is discussed. It was demonstrated that the proposed method achieves high data classification accuracy and significantly enhances the effectiveness and learning outcomes of English translation education.;[Zhu, Qiuyan] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Languages Educ, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China;Shandong University of Finance & Economics;Zhu, QY (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Languages Educ, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China.;zhuqiuyan2023@yeah.net;"Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020; zhao, wei/JZD-4475-2024; Wang, Zejun/KBB-8454-2024; Zhang, Xiaofeng/JMC-6060-2023; PENG, CHENG/KCL-2506-2024; Liu, Shaobo/JUU-5767-2023; CHEN, WENJIE/JQW-1608-2023";"Wang, Jiacheng/0000-0003-4327-1508; Zhang, Xiaofeng/0000-0003-2738-3286;";;;;;27;2;2;5;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;SEP;2023;27;17;;;;;12725;12740;;10.1007/s00500-023-08850-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-023-08850-1;;JUN 2023;16;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;M5RV1;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001020290600012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although student assessments are frequently used for evaluating teaching behavior, they are mainly in Likert-scale or categorical forms, which precludes students from freely expressing their perceptions of teaching. Drawing on an open-ended questionnaire from large-scale student surveys, this study uses a machine learning tool aiming to extract teaching behavior topics from large-scale students' open-ended answers and to test the convergent validity of the outcomes by comparing them with theory-driven manual coding outcomes based on expert judgments. We applied a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis, together with a visualization tool (LDAvis), to qualitative data collected from 173,858 secondary education students in the Netherlands. This data-driven machine learning analysis yielded eight topics of teaching behavior domains: Clear explanation, Student-centered supportive learning climate, Lesson variety, Likable characteristics of the teacher, Evoking interest, Monitoring understanding, Inclusiveness and equity, Lesson objectives and formative assessment. In addition, we subjected 864 randomly selected student responses from the same dataset to manual coding, and performed theory-driven content analysis, which resulted in nine teaching behavior domains and 19 sub-domains. Results suggest that the relation between machine learning and human analysis is complementary. By comparing the bottom-up (machine learning analysis) and top-down (content analysis), we found that the pro-posed topic modeling approach reveals unique domains of teaching behavior, and confirmed the validity of the topic modeling outcomes evident from the overlapping topics.;"[Gencoglu, Bilge; Helms-Lorenz, Michelle; Maulana, Ridwan; Jansen, Ellen P.

Numerical modeling plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of these flows and making suitable decisions. However, the traditional process of developing numerical solvers is time-consuming and error-prone. Objectives: This paper aims to present the design, implementation and verification of a fully coupled finite element solver for the simulation of natural convection in porous media, by making use of automated solution techniques. Methods: The mathematical model is composed of the mass conservation equation for fluid flow, Darcy's law to relate pressure and velocity, and the advection-diffusion equation for the temperature/concentration field. In order to discretize the system of equations, a mixed finite element pair, namely a Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element and a discontinuous Galerkin element, is used to interpolate the velocity and the pressure field, respectively, while a discontinuous Galerkin element is chosen for the temperature/concentration. With the help of automated solution techniques, a readable and extensible code is developed for this class of multiphysics problems. The code is developed with FEniCS, an open-source framework for the automated solution of partial differential equations through the finite element method. Results: After a convergence test using the method of manufactured solutions, the developed solver is validated by comparing the numerical results against commonly cited benchmarks.

To understand the relationship between students' learning of coding principles in educational tabletop games and players' cognitive processing at key points in time, students' behavior while playing the Interstellar Explorer tabletop game was observed by a brainwave EEG (electroencephalography) instrument and video and analyzed with cognitive processing. The results showed that a continuous increase in attention and meditation reflected a low level of knowledge and understanding as well as high-level application, analysis and evaluation of cognitive processing. This study explores the relationship between the state of students playing tabletop games and their behavior during play and then derives the relationship between their behavior and cognitive processing. It is recommended that the design of tabletop games consider how the learning content matches the game mechanics and examine whether cognitive processing is present according to Bloom's taxonomy. In addition, to enhance players' cognitive ability, it is recommended that tabletop games provide the ability to use contextual content and multiple strategies.;"[Wu, Sheng-Yi] Natl Pingtung Univ, Dept Sci Commun, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Su, Yu-Sheng] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Keelung, Taiwan";"National Pingtung University; National Taiwan Ocean University";Su, YS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Keelung, Taiwan.;"digschool@gmail.com; ntouaddisonsu@gmail.com";Su, Yu-Sheng/ABD-3489-2020;"Su, Yu-Sheng/0000-0002-1531-3363; Wu, Sheng-Yi/0000-0003-3022-1843";Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 108-2511-H-153-009, MOST 108-2511-H-153-010, MOST 108-2511-H-019-002, MOST 108-2511-H-019-003, MOST 109-2511-H-019-004-MY2, MOST 109-2511-H-019-001];Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under contract numbers MOST 108-2511-H-153-009, MOST 108-2511-H-153-010, MOST 108-2511-H-019-002, MOST 108-2511-H-019-003, MOST 109-2511-H-019-004-MY2 and MOST 109-2511-H-019-001.;;40;4;4;2;37;LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV;HUALIEN;LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV, HUALIEN, 00000, TAIWAN;1607-9264;2079-4029;;J INTERNET TECHNOL;J.

SG implementation has challenges in accurate prediction of electricity consumption, power stability, power quality, and critical infrastructure security. This study uses predictive modeling and different tools to introduce problem-based learning techniques through household electricity consumption (HEC) analysis. The problem statement is to understand the effect of the weather conditioning data set on the accuracy of HEC prediction and select the most fitting predictive model for further decision-making. Five predictive models, namely random forest, linear regression, support vector machine, neural network, and adaptive boosting, are utilized, and their prediction results are compared based on a performance matrix. The paper also briefs the usage of different tools, including Jeffrey's Amazing Statistics Program tool for finding the correlations within variables, the Power Business Intelligence tool for data visualization, and the Orange tool for building predictive modeling. This study focuses on three aspects. Firstly, to demonstrate energy predictive modeling analysis without knowing the coding knowledge. Secondly, to develop the creative thinking of engineering students to solve complex, interdisciplinary engineering problems using tools. Thirdly, to motivate students to be actively involved in their problem-based research projects.;"[Ramnath, Gaikwad S.; Harikrishnan, R.] Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ SIDU, Symbiosis Inst Technol SIT, Dept Elect & Telecommun, Pune 412115, Maharashtra, India";"Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis Institute of Technology (SIT)";Harikrishnan, R (corresponding author), Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ SIDU, Symbiosis Inst Technol SIT, Dept Elect & Telecommun, Pune 412115, Maharashtra, India.;rhareish@gmail.com;R, Harikrishnan/A-4242-2017;"R, Harikrishnan/0000-0001-5512-2345; Gaikwad, Sachin/0000-0002-3343-7423";;;;;42;3;3;0;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Understanding and satisfying stakeholder needs and wants is the difference between the success and failure of a product. However, RE is often perceived as a soft skill by students and is often ignored by students who prioritize the learning of coding, testing, and algorithmic thinking. This view contrasts with the industry, where soft skills are instead valued equal to any other engineering ability. A key challenge in teaching RE is that students who are accustomed to technical work have a hard time relating to something that is non-technical. Furthermore, students are rarely afforded the opportunity to practice requirements elicitation and management skills in a meaningful way while learning the RE concepts as an adjunct to other content. At Rose-Hulman, several project based approaches have been experimented with in teaching RE, and these have evolved over time. In this paper, the progress of teaching methodologies is documented to capture the pros and cons of these varied approaches, and to reflect on what worked and what did not in teaching RE to undergraduate engineering students.;"[Rupakheti, Chandan R.; Hays, Mark; Mohan, Sriram; Chenoweth, Stephen; Stouder, Amanda] Rose Hulman Inst Technol, 5500 Wabash Ave,CM 100, Terre Haute, IN 47803 USA";Rose Hulman Institute Technology;Rupakheti, CR (corresponding author), Rose Hulman Inst Technol, 5500 Wabash Ave,CM 100, Terre Haute, IN 47803 USA.;"rupakhet@rose-hulman.edu; hays@rose-hulman.edu; mohan@rose-hulman.edu; chenowet@rose-hulman.edu; stouder@rose-hulman.edu";;;;;;;56;7;7;0;22;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0164-1212;1873-1228;;J SYST SOFTWARE;J.

Design/methodology/approach This qualitative case study includes a total of ten student participants. Two theoretical orientations guide the study. Mishra and Koehler's (2006) model of technological pedagogical content knowledge is provided to understand the reciprocal relationship between content, pedagogy, knowledge and technology in online learning environments. Critical digital pedagogy (Morris and Stommel, 2018) provides insights into challenging the neutrality of technological tools and focuses on relational capacities of online learning environments. Initial coding by each researcher was reduced to thematic codes focused on technological tools, course content delivery, asynchronous and synchronous pedagogical strategies. Findings Data analysis revealed technological tools such as discussion boards, video, video conferencing and synchronous opportunities influence student engagement and learning. Further, findings reveal that the nature of online education itself - specifically asynchronocity - functions as both a distraction and possibility for online learning in multicultural education courses. Students in this study revealed the value of opportunities to engage synchronously in online learning environments. Instruction without such opportunities was disadvantageous to the learning of skills and knowledge associated with multicultural competence. Research limitations/implications - The study is not generalizable to the experiences of all online students and only provides a small cross-section of online graduate students enrolled in a required diversity course at one institution. Originality/value There is a dearth of research focused on teaching courses in diversity, equity, social justice and inclusion in fully online environments, a gap this study begins to fill. The study also enhances the authors' understanding of graduate student education.;"[Montelongo, Ricardo; Eaton, Paul William] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership, Coll Educ, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA";"Texas State University System; Sam Houston State University";Montelongo, R (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Educ Leadership, Coll Educ, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA.;"rxm059@shsu.edu; pwe003@shsu.edu";;;;;;;28;14;19;0;17;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2056-4880;;;INT J INF LEARN TECH;Int.

The scientific focus and challenge in simulations move from understanding system complexity to actually prototyping online and distributed regulatory mechanisms for supporting system operations. Existing simulation tools are not designed to address the challenges of this new reality, however, simulation is all about capturing reality at an adequate level of detail. This paper fills this gap by introducing a Java-based distributed simulation framework for inter-connected and interdependent techno-socio-economic system: SFINA, the Simulation Framework for Intelligent Network Adaptations. Three layers outline the design approach of SFINA: (i) integration of domain knowledge and dynamics that govern various techno-socio-economic systems, (ii) system modeling with dynamic flow networks represented by temporal directed weighted graphs and (iii) simulation of generic regulation models, policies and mechanisms applicable in several domains. SPINA aims at minimizing the fragmentation and discrepancies between different simulation communities by allowing the interoperability of SFINA with several other existing domain backends. The coupling of three such backends with SFINA is illustrated in the domain of Smart Grids and disaster mitigation. It is shown that the same model of cascading failures in Smart Grids is developed once and evaluated with both IVIATPOWER and InterPSS backends without changing a single line of application code. Similarly, application code developed in SFINA is reused for the evaluation of mitigation strategies in a backend that simulates the flows of a disaster spread. Results provide a proof-of-concept for the high modularity and reconfigurability of SFINA and puts the foundations of a new generation of simulation tools that prototype and validate online decentralized regulation in techno-socio-economic systems.

This can lead to divergence in electronic implementations, reducing the usefulness of collected data outside of that implementation setting. This work set out to evolve guidelines-based data dictionaries by mapping to HL7 Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and semantic terminology, thus progressing toward machine-readable guidelines that define the minimum data set required to support family planning and sexually transmitted infections. Material and methods: The data dictionaries were first structured to facilitate mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies, including ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. FHIR resources and codes were assigned to data dictionary terms. The data dictionary and mappings were used as inputs for a newly developed tool to generate FHIR implementation guides. Results: Implementation guides for core data requirements for family planning and sexually transmitted infections were created. These implementation guides display data dictionary content as FHIR resources and semantic terminology codes. Challenges included the use of a two-dimensional spreadsheet to facilitate mapping, the need to create FHIR profiles and resource extensions, and applying FHIR to a data dictionary that was created with a user interface in mind. Conclusions: Authoring FHIR implementation guides is a complex and evolving practice, and there are limited examples for this groundbreaking work. Moving toward machine-readable guidelines by mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies requires a thorough understanding of the context and use of terminology, an applied information model, and other strategies for optimizing the creation and long-term management of implementation guides. Next steps for this work include validation and, eventually, real-world application. The process for creating the data dictionary and for generating implementation guides should also be improved to prepare for this expanding work.;"[Shivers, Jennifer; Amlung, Joseph; Biondich, Paul] Regenstrief Inst Hlth Care, Global Hlth Informat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Ratanaprayul, Natschja] WHO, Publ Digital Hlth Technol, Dept Digital Hlth & Innovat, Geneva, Switzerland; [Rhodes, Bryn] Alphora, Orem, UT USA";"Regenstrief Institute Inc; World Health Organization";Shivers, J (corresponding author), Regenstrief Inst Hlth Care, Global Hlth Informat, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.;jeshiver@regenstrief.org;;Amlung, Joseph/0000-0001-6290-6535;;;;;27;9;11;0;8;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1532-0464;1532-0480;;J BIOMED INFORM;J.

J;Peng, CH;;;;Peng, Changhong;;;An Application of English Reading Mobile Teaching Model Based on K-Means Algorithm;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;SCIENCE;The rapid development and maturity of emerging technologies such as mobile Internet and artificial intelligence have had a subversive impact on all aspects of teaching, and mobile learning has become the normal learning of students. Educational technology has developed from traditional technology and ordinary media technology to multimedia information network technology. Personal computers and wired networks have been more and more widely used. Wireless communication technology and mobile Internet technology of mobile computing devices will be popularized, and the trend from digital learning to mobility will be more and more obvious. This study uses the k-means algorithm to analyze the English reading performance, finds out the factors affecting the test performance, provides guidance for improving the pass rate of CET-4, and focuses on the rise of mobile learning under this background and its specific application in English teaching. The experimental results show that 39 students (55%) believe that mobile reading learning provides rich and real reading materials, can obtain real and authentic language input, and increase their interest in English reading. 31 students (44%) believed that the learning model was helpful to enhance autonomous learning ability. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of this clustering algorithm is that it has high scalability and efficiency in the processing of large data sets. The mobile teaching model of English reading based on the k-means algorithm can more effectively promote the interaction of English reading teaching and improve students' English text reading comprehension ability than the traditional teaching model. In addition, it can promote students' active learning and cultivate students' awareness of autonomous learning and cooperation.;[Peng, Changhong] Shanghai Univ Finance, Econ Zhejiang Coll, Dept English, Jinhua 321000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China;;Peng, CH (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance, Econ Zhejiang Coll, Dept English, Jinhua 321000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;z2012225@shufe-zj.edu.cn;PENG, changhong/AAP-5385-2020;Peng, Changhong/0000-0002-3963-5906;;;;;30;3;3;4;27;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

J;Liu, YJ;;;;Liu, Yajun;;;The Role of Bisection Class in Guiding Teenagers' Core Values from the Perspective of Deep Learning;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Effective classrooms(EC) encourage students to participate in conversations, investigations, and experiments that help them learn and grow. Even in small groups, students are responsible for much of their learning. Split classrooms are ones where pupils from two or more grade levels are placed in the same classroom. Values taught in the classroom may aid students in distinguishing between right and wrong, influencing their attitudes and behaviours as adults. Some of the problems are students' lack of cooperation, empathy, and support for one another, insufficient financing for classroom resources and equipment, and students' unable to keep up with education because teachers are held more responsible than they should be to increase meaningful academic learning and facilitate social and emotional growth. Video editing programs provide a more satisfying sensory experience than just reading from printed information. Deep learning (DL) allows pupils to think critically and successfully collaborate with others in all academic areas. Deep learning is a strategy and attitude to learning using complex mental talents such as the ability to analyze, create, solve issues, and think the state of play to build long-term comprehension. Using this method, EC-DL decent employment is becoming more cognitively demanding, and advanced skills are essential for students to cope with this reality. Due to this programmer, students become interested, autonomous learners, and active citizens in a democratic society. Classrooms were successful because they incorporated exploratory learning through guided inquiry-based activities, which increased students' curiosity and encouraged them to develop higher-order thinking skills. In-class learning activities must be purposefully designed. According to one study, classes positively influenced student learning and success.;[Liu, Yajun] Guangdong Mech & Elect Polytech, Sch Marxism, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China;;Liu, YJ (corresponding author), Guangdong Mech & Elect Polytech, Sch Marxism, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;2020010037@gdmec.edu.cn;;;2021 party construction research project of Guangdong University Party Construction Research Association [ZXRW20220029];2021 party construction research project of Guangdong University Party Construction Research Association;"This work was supported by Project Name: 2021 party construction research project of Guangdong University Party Construction Research Association (no.

As a result, companies need more manufacturing engineers who are aware of ergonomics risk analysis. Thus, undergraduate students in the 3rd year in Industrial Engineering at Dokuz Eylul University are invited to take part in a real-life experience. This paper introduces an Excel-based program which is called Quick Ergonomic Assessment Techniques (QEAT); in order to support teaching students ergonomic risk assessment techniques; facilitate understanding characteristics of different techniques, and enable to compare the results of them. Three of the well-known ergonomic risk assessment techniques are coded in QEAT and applied on an electronics company which manufactures TV. The proposed QEAT procedure is easy to apply in various manufacturing environments and is suitable to be implemented in undergraduate engineering laboratories in order to support and encourage ergonomics study. The results show that by using the combination of three techniques in QEAT, an ergonomic risk assessment which covers most of the body areas could be presented and manufacturing environment could be reanalyzed easily if it is needed due to the changes in production processes.

However, for many small organisations and freelance innovators, large-scale computations remain beyond reach because of the small accessibility of computation resources and the lack of knowledge required to use them efficiently. The BalticLSC Platform is a software development and computing environment created to address this issue. This paper presents the associated software development process. The platform users can perform advanced computations using ready applications or develop new applications quickly from available components. This can be done using a visual notation called the Computation Application Language (CAL). CAL programs are developed in a dedicated online editor, through selecting and connecting reusable computation modules. If a required module is missing, it can be quickly created by encapsulating code inside a standardised container. The platform's ultimate goal is to relieve the developers from the need to understand the complexity of the distributed parallel computation environment. The platform was implemented in the form of an online software development portal. Validation of the platform consisted in the development of applications and modules by students not experienced in programming. The results of this validation acknowledge the required platform's characteristics.;"[Marek, Krzysztof; Smialek, Michal; Rybinski, Kamil; Roszczyk, Radoslaw; Wdowiak, Marek] Warsaw Univ Technol, Plac Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland";Warsaw University of Technology;Marek, K (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Plac Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.;Krzysztof.Marek@pw.edu.pl;"Wdowiak, Marek/Q-7806-2016; Roszczyk, Radosław/AAU-3081-2021; Smialek, Michal/J-4240-2018";"Roszczyk, Radosław/0000-0003-0721-6739; Marek, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0199-4839; Smialek, Michal/0000-0001-6170-443X";;;;;15;5;5;5;18;SLOVAK ACAD SCIENCES INST INFORMATICS;BRATISLAVA;DUBRAVSKA CESTA 9, 84237 BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA;1335-9150;;;COMPUT INFORM;Comput.

Although bad smells often occur in source code, bad smells also exist in representations of design descriptions and models. We have observed that many users of graphical modeling environments (e.g., LabVIEW) are systems engineers who may not be aware of core software engineering techniques, such as refactoring of bad smells. Systems engineers often focus on implementation correctness and may be unaware of how their designs affect long-term maintenance properties that may increase design smells. There exists a large body of research focused on analysing bad smells embedded in the source code of textual languages, but there has been limited research on bad smells in systems models of graphical languages. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach for extracting design smells across versions of LabVIEW graphical models through user-defined queries. We describe example queries that highlight the emergence of design smells that we discovered from posts in the LabVIEW user's forum. We then demonstrate the use of the example queries in understanding the evolution of seven bad smells we found in 81 LabVIEW models stored in 10 GitHub repositories. We analyze the evolution of these smells in order to understand the prevalence and introduction of bad smells, as well as the relationship between bad smells and the structural changes made to the models. Our results show that all of the models contain instances of at least one type of bad smell and the number of smells fluctuates as the size of a model increases. Furthermore, the majority of the structural changes across different versions of LabVIEW models involve the addition of new elements with a corresponding increase in the presence of design smells. This paper summarizes the need for better analysis of design smells in systems models and suggests an approach that may assist in improving the structure and quality of systems models developed in LabVIEW.;"[Popoola, Saheed; Zhao, Xin; Gray, Jeff] Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA";"University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa";Popoola, S (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.;"sopopoola@crimson.ua.edu; xzhao24@crimson.ua.edu; gray@cs.ua.edu";;"Popoola, Saheed/0000-0002-9602-6322; Gray, Jeff/0000-0003-0082-6753";;;;;31;4;4;0;9;JOURNAL OBJECT TECHNOLOGY;ZURICH;ETH ZURICH, RZ BLDG, CLAUSIUSSTRASSE 59, ZURICH, 8092, SWITZERLAND;1660-1769;;;J OBJECT TECHNOL;J.

Cleanroom Software Engineering model is a theory based and team oriented model that is based on development and certification of software in increments using statistical quality control [Linger 96]. SUT is a black box testing technique and concentrates on how the software completes its required function from the user's perspective [Runeson, 93]. SUT is carried out by developing usage models and assigning usage probabilities. Testing is carried out on usage models by performing statistical tests which are random sequences [Trammel 95]. Statistical testing can be viewed as a statistical experiment where random test cases are selected from all the usage models [Trammel 95]. This paper demonstrates the process and benefits of applying SUT at different levels of testing. Levels of testing include Unit level, Integration level, System level and Acceptance level. SUT is generally performed at System level and Unit testing is not the part of SUT. Unit testing makes it easier to access code and debug human errors. Detecting errors at an early stage helps reducing cost and effort. The paper proposes to allow Unit testing in Cleanroom Software Engineering Model, thus making it more flexible and suitable for varied applications. Unit testing is essentially performed to ensure that the code is working correctly and meets the user specifications [istqb, 15]. Errors may also exist when modules are integrated because of interchange of data and control information between various modules. Integration testing is performed when the modules are combined together to check their behaviour and functionality after integration. Once the Integration testing phase gets successfully completed, System testing is performed on the whole system [test-institute, 15]. The paper makes use of Student record software to demonstrate the process of performing SUT at different levels. In addition to performing SUT at System level, this paper helps in understanding the advantages of applying SUT at Unit level and Integration level.;"[Kaur, Kamaldeep] New Delhi Inst Management, New Delhi, India; [Khatri, Sunil Kumar] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Inst Informat Technol, Noida, India; [Mishra, Alok] Atilim Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Datta, Rattan] Mohyal Educ & Res Inst Technol, Delhi, India";"Amity University Noida; Atilim University";Kaur, K (corresponding author), New Delhi Inst Management, New Delhi, India.;"kamaldeepkaurkalsi@yahoo.co.in; skkhatri@amity.edu; alok.mishra@atilim.edu.tr; Rkdatta_in@yahoo.com";"Mishra, Alok/AAE-2673-2019; Khatri, Dr. Sunil Kumar/J-7795-2017";"Mishra, Alok/0000-0003-1275-2050; Khatri, Dr. Sunil Kumar/0000-0003-4373-9000";;;;;12;0;0;0;5;GRAZ UNIV TECHNOLGOY, INST INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPUTER MEDIA-IICM;GRAZ;INFFELDGASSE 16C, GRAZ, A-8010, AUSTRIA;0948-695X;;;J UNIVERS COMPUT SCI;J.

Data fusion technology refers to the information processing technology that uses computer to automatically analyze and synthesize several observation information obtained in time series under certain criteria to complete the required decision-making and evaluation tasks. In this paper, the traditional teaching mode on students' learning and other aspects of help is not very obvious, and video teaching method can not only increase students' interest in learning, but also help their learning is very huge. Teaching video is to make the knowledge, skills, and other content that teachers want to impart to students into video form to assist modern multimedia teaching. In this paper, two classes with the same number and similar average test scores were selected as the experimental objects. The test results are evaluated by f-s-o algorithm, f-s-o matrix, variance proportion method, and teaching evaluation, so as to get more accurate results. In the experiment, two classes with 30 students were selected, and different teaching methods were adopted for the two classes. One class adopted the traditional teaching mode, and the other class used the video teaching method. During the 4-month experiment, there was no significant difference in test scores and comprehension between the two classes in the first month. The ratio of the two classes was 5 : 3 in the second month, 10 : 5 in the third month, and 20 : 7 in the fourth month. Through the comparative evaluation of the test results of four months, the experimental results show that the video teaching method can not only mobilize the enthusiasm of students but also plays a very important role in promoting students' performance.;"[Zou, Wei; Shan, Xinru; Wu, Xinge] Huazhong Agirculture Univ, Dept Sports, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanlong] Harbin Sports Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Harbin 150008, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China";Harbin Sport University;Li, YL (corresponding author), Harbin Sports Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Harbin 150008, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.;liyanlong@hrbipe.edu.cn;;;"Physical education of Harbin Sports University (special project of echelon construction) [XKB04]; Open Fund Project of Hubei Leisure Sports Development Research Center [2020Y016]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central universities [2662020TYPY001]";"Physical education of Harbin Sports University (special project of echelon construction); Open Fund Project of Hubei Leisure Sports Development Research Center; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)";"This work was supported by Physical education of Harbin Sports University (special project of echelon construction) (XKB04); Open Fund Project of Hubei Leisure Sports Development Research Center (2020Y016); and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central universities (program no. 2662020TYPY001).";;33;5;5;4;17;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1939-0114;1939-0122;;SECUR COMMUN NETW;Secur.

We first conceptualize small group learning as a complex system and explain how group dynamics and interaction can be modeled via theoretically grounded, simple rules. These rules are then operationalized to build temporally-embodied measures, where varying weights are assigned to the same measures according to their significance during different time stages based on the golden ratio concept. This theory-based measure construction method in combination with a correlation-based feature subset selection algorithm reduces data dimensionality, making a complex system more understandable for people. Further, because the discipline of education often generates small datasets, a Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes classifier was coded to develop an assessment model, which achieves the highest accuracy (95.8%) as compared to baseline models. Finally, we describe a web-based tool that visualizes time-series activities, assesses small group learning automatically, and also offers actionable intelligence for teachers to provide real-time support and intervention to students. The fundamental contribution of this paper is that it makes complex, small group behavior visible to teachers in a learning context quickly.

The laboratory web virtual instruments interfaces are hosted on the SystemLink cloud and SystemLink server. A user-friendly interface has been designed to help students to understand important electronic concepts. Virtual and real experiments were fused to give students a wide range of experiments they can access online. The instructor can check outputs of an experiment being executed on the device. Achieving connection between myRIO and SystemLink through global variables and SystemLink ensured that the low-cost device was utilized, and this is suitable for third-world countries' universities that cannot afford expensive equipment. Students can perform the experiments which have some resemblance to physical execution. The system is expandable in that the number of myRIO devices or number of experiments can be increased to suit changing requirements.

Explicit and implicit formulations are available, but for both the learning curve for understanding the method and arriving at a useful implementation is severe. Researchers must understand and implement finite element analysis, non-linear material behaviour, finite deformation mechanics and non-linear solution methods before they can even verify their formulations.

J;Jwo, DJ;;;;Jwo, Dah-Jing;;;Notes on Convergence and Modeling for the Extended Kalman Filter;CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Kalman filter; extended kalman filter; convergence; modeling; optimization";;The goal of this work is to provide an understanding of estimation technology for both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. A critical analysis of both the Kalman filter (KF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) will be provided, along with examples to illustrate some important issues related to filtering convergence due to system modeling. A conceptual explanation of the topic with illustrative examples provided in the paper can help the readers capture the essential principles and avoid making mistakes while implementing the algorithms. Adding fictitious process noise to the system model assumed by the filter designers for convergence assurance is being investigated. A comparison of estimation accuracy with linear and nonlinear measurements is made. Parameter identification by the state estimation method through the augmentation of the state vector is also discussed. The intended readers of this article may include researchers, working engineers, or engineering students. This article can serve as a better understanding of the topic as well as a further connection to probability, stochastic process, and system theory. The lesson learned enables the readers to interpret the theory and algorithms appropriately and precisely implement the computer codes that nicely match the estimation algorithms related to the mathematical equations. This is especially helpful for those readers with less experience or background in optimal estimation theory, as it provides a solid foundation for further study on the theory and applications of the topic.;[Jwo, Dah-Jing] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Commun Nav & Control Engn, Keelung 202301, Taiwan;National Taiwan Ocean University;Jwo, DJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Commun Nav & Control Engn, Keelung 202301, Taiwan.;djjwo@mail.ntou.edu.tw;;;Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 110-2221-E-019-042];Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);Funding Statement: This work has been partially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (Grant Number MOST 110-2221-E-019-042) .;;26;0;0;2;2;TECH SCIENCE PRESS;HENDERSON;871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA;1546-2218;1546-2226;;CMC-COMPUT MATER CON;CMC-Comput.

Accordingly, we can achieve semantic communication in terms of joint semantic source and channel coding over a noisy channel with the help of NLP. However, the existing method to realize this goal is to use a fixed transformer of NLP while ignoring the difference of semantic information contained in each sentence. To solve this problem, we propose a new semantic communication system based on Universal Transformer. Compared with the traditional transformer, an adaptive circulation mechanism is introduced in the Universal Transformer. Through the introduction of the circulation mechanism, the new semantic communication system can be more flexible to transmit sentences with different semantic information, and achieve better end-to-end performance under various channel conditions.;"[Zhou, Qingyang; Li, Rongpeng; Zhang, Honggang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Elect Engn ISEE, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhifeng] Zhejiang Univ, Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou 311121, Peoples R China; [Peng, Chenghui] Huawei, Wireless Technol Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China";"Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Laboratory; Huawei Technologies";Li, RP (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Elect Engn ISEE, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.;"22060638@zju.edu.cn; lirongpeng@zju.edu.cn; zhaozf@zhejianglab.com; pengchenghui@huawei.com; honggangzhang@zju.edu.cn";;"zhifeng, zhao/0000-0002-5479-7890; Zhang, Honggang/0000-0003-1492-1364";"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFB1804800]; National NSF of China [61731002, 62071425]; Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan [2019C01002, 2019C03131]; Huawei Cooperation Project; Zhejiang Provincial NSF of China [LY20F010016]";"National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National NSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan; Huawei Cooperation Project(Huawei Technologies); Zhejiang Provincial NSF of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)";"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1804800; in part by the National NSF of China under Grant 61731002 and Grant 62071425; in part by the Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan under Grant 2019C01002 and Grant 2019C03131; in part by Huawei Cooperation Project; and in part by the Zhejiang Provincial NSF of China under Grant LY20F010016.";;14;43;49;8;52;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2162-2337;2162-2345;;IEEE WIREL COMMUN LE;IEEE Wirel.

This makes it an essential skill for students in many disciplines to learn. However, OOP is known to be challenging to learn and teach due to its abstract nature. Studies have shown that students often face difficulties and develop misconceptions in multiple aspects when learning OOP. This article presents a systematic way of developing a teaching tool that uses a combination of visualization and analogies to help students overcome these barriers and understand the OOP concepts better. To ensure the tool would have pedagogical value and novelty, we first reviewed the educational theories on using analogies and visualization, as well as numerous existing tools. A set of activities in the form of code snippets were then designed to target these misconceptions and difficulties, along with a set of analogies and their interaction mechanisms that mapped to the OOP concepts. A teaching tool was then developed based on those designs and evaluated with engineering students in a CS2 course (n = 253). The results and our analysis show that a statistically significant improvement was achieved in student understanding and confidence through interaction with visualization of OOP concepts with analogies (VOOPA) exercises. Similar gains were also observed using more traditional methods. No statistically significant positive difference in understanding and confidence can be attributed to use of VOOPA through the current study.;"[Lian, Victor; Varoy, Elliot; Giacaman, Nasser] Univ Auckland, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand";University of Auckland;Giacaman, N (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.;"vlia679@aucklanduni.ac.nz; evar872@aucklanduni.ac.nz; n.giacaman@auckland.ac.nz";;;;;;;58;3;3;8;21;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

Such an evaluation generally provides a single decision based on a rubric, most commonly whether the submission successfully accomplished the assignment. Nevertheless, since in an educational context such information may be deemed insufficient, it would be beneficial for both the student and the instructor to receive additional feedback about the overall development of the task. This work aims to tackle this limitation by considering the further exploitation of the information gathered by the OJ and automatically inferring feedback for both the student and the instructor. More precisely, we consider the use of learning-based schemes-particularly, multi-instance learning (MIL) and classical machine learning formulations-to model student behavior. Besides, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is contemplated to provide human-understandable feedback. The proposal has been evaluated considering a case of study comprising 2500 submissions from roughly 90 different students from a programming-related course in a computer science degree. The results obtained validate the proposal: The model is capable of significantly predicting the user outcome (either passing or failing the assignment) solely based on the behavioral pattern inferred by the submissions provided to the OJ. Moreover, the proposal is able to identify prone-to-fail student groups and profiles as well as other relevant information, which eventually serves as feedback to both the student and the instructor.;"[Rico-Juan, Juan Ramon; Sanchez-Cartagena, Victor M.; Valero-Mas, Jose J.; Gallego, Antonio Javier] Univ Alicante, Dept Software & Comp Syst, Alicante 03690, Spain";Universitat d'Alacant;Gallego, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Software & Comp Syst, Alicante 03690, Spain.;"juanramonrico@ua.es; vmsanchez@dlsi.ua.es; jjvalero@dlsi.ua.es; jgallego@dlsi.ua.es";"Valero-Mas, Jose J./HSB-4673-2023; RICO-JUAN, Juan Ramón/AAQ-9737-2021; Gallego, Antonio Javier/AAE-3627-2019";"Valero-Mas, Jose J./0000-0001-8667-4070; RICO-JUAN, Juan Ramón/0000-0002-9199-5802; Gallego, Antonio Javier/0000-0003-3148-6886";Programa Redes-I3CE de investigacion en docencia Universitaria del Instituto de Ciencias de la Educacion;Programa Redes-I3CE de investigacion en docencia Universitaria del Instituto de Ciencias de la Educacion;No Statement Available;;69;1;1;7;10;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

However, peer feedback can play an important role in alleviating learning burnout. This study uses a combination of deep learning (DL) and statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between online peer feedback and learning burnout. Several DL algorithms, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and BERT-Bi-LSTM, are compared to classify peer comments in terms of cognitive content and affective state. Moreover, by using the feedback classified by DL and survey data from 116 participants, multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis is employed to explore the relationships between online learning burnout and feedback messages. The results show that the BERT model achieves the best performance in terms of classification performance and agreement with manual coding. Further, we find that student burnout is significantly influenced by peer feedback. Individuals who receive more suggestive feedback experience a greater reduction in emotional exhaustion. However, when receiving more reinforcing feedback without guidance, learners' behavior tends to deteriorate. From an affective perspective, the more positive feedback the learners receive, the more they tend to exhibit higher levels of emotional exhaustion and a diminished sense of achievement. And when receiving more negative feedback, learners tend to have a worse emotional experience and demonstrate poorer self-learning behavior. This study contributes to our understanding of the application of DL in peer assessment and the impact of received peer feedback on preventing and alleviating learning burnout.;"[Huang, Changqin; Tu, Yaxin; Han, Zhongmei; Jiang, Fan; Jiang, Yunliang] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applicat Zhejia, Jinhua, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Fei] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yunliang] Huzhou Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Huzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China";"Zhejiang Normal University; Zhejiang University; Huzhou University";Jiang, YL (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applicat Zhejia, Jinhua, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;"cqhuang@zju.edu.cn; tuyx1996@zjnu.edu.cn; zm.han@zjnu.edu.cn; fanjiang@zjnu.edu.cn; wufei@cs.zju.edu.cn; jyl2022@zjnu.cn";"Tu, Yaxin/HSF-3326-2023; Jiang, Fan/GQQ-9024-2022";"Tu, Yaxin/0000-0003-2886-425X; Jiang, Fan/0000-0003-1679-3394; Huang, Changqin/0000-0003-1371-2608";"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62037001, 62337001]; National Key Ramp;D Program of China [2022ZD0117104]; Key Ramp;D Program of Zhejiang Province [2022C03106]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Ramp;D Program of China; Key Ramp;D Program of Zhejiang Province";This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62037001, 62337001) , the National Key R & D Program of China (Grant No. 2022ZD0117104) , and the Key R & D Program of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. 2022C03106) .

Software tool development is an important skills in the software engineering. However, generic teaching courses are hard to evaluate the integrated development skills from undergraduate students. This paper proposed a continuous collaboration model (CCM) and a view-based semi-automatic tool, OpenNeeds, develop and run as an Eclipse plug-in to proceed the functional requirements' analysis. These selected methods and tools include programming languages, markup language, information exchange standards, modeling language, model-view-controller (MVC) software framework, virtual machine handling, interface development environment, version control platform, knowledge management, software documentation, and software unit tests. The MVC tool can simply manipulate several requirement-related graphical components, such as mind view and use case view. The lateral thinking approach is adapted in grid view to assist in analyzing other potential requirements from the original ones. Subsequently, the source codes of this tool are opened and can be distributed via the Eclipse Public License from the OpenFoundry and Github repositories. There are three professors who come from two distinct colleges to share their learning experiences. Meanwhile, 26 and 27 college students attend this team in the first and second year, respectively. Professors can truly understand the fortes of the individual attendee through the attending performance and promote his/her merits in the future tasks. Further, their industrial practices and related outcomes might disclose that the proposed CCM is feasible and trustable in college environment, especially for the software development activities in the software engineering field.

Negative health outcomes associated with vaping products have created public uncertainty and debates on social media platforms. This study explores the feasibility of using social media as a surveillance tool to identify relevant posts and at-risk vaping users. Methods: Using an interdisciplinary method that leverages natural language processing and manual content analysis, we extracted and analyzed 794,620 vaping-related tweets on Twitter. After observing significant increases in vaping-related tweets in July, August, and September 2019, additional human coding was completed on a subset of these tweets to better understand primary themes of vaping-related dis-cussions on Twitter during this time frame. Results: We found significant increases in tweets related to negative health outcomes such as acute lung injury and respiratory issues during the outbreak of e-cigarette/vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) in the fall of 2019. Positive sentiment toward vaping remained high, even across the peak of this outbreak in July, August, and September. Tweets mentioning the public perceptions of youth risk were concerning, as were increases in marketing and marijuana-related tweets during this time. Discussion: The preliminary results of this study suggest the feasibility of using Twitter as a means of surveillance for public health crises, and themes found in this research could aid in specifying those groups or populations at risk on Twitter. As such, we plan to build automatic detection algorithms to identify these unique vaping users to connect them with a digital intervention in the future.;"[Kasson, Erin; Cavazos-Rehg, Patricia] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Singh, Avineet Kumar] Univ South Carolina, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Huang, Ming] Mayo Clin, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Informat, Rochester, MN USA; [Wu, Dezhi] Univ South Carolina, Dept Integrated Informat Technol, Columbia, SC 29208 USA";"Washington University (WUSTL); University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Mayo Clinic; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia";Wu, DZ (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Dept Integrated Informat Technol, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.;dezhiwu@cec.sc.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) [K02 DA043657]; University of South Carolina [80002838]; USC Big Data Health Science Center; USC excellence initiative program [BDHSC-2021-14]; National Institute on Drug Abuse [K02DA043657] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";"National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); University of South Carolina; USC Big Data Health Science Center; USC excellence initiative program; National Institute on Drug Abuse(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA))";Funding for this work was provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [Grant No: K02 DA043657 AWARD (Cavazos-Rehg), the University of South Carolina [Grant No: 80002838 (Wu)], and with partial support from the USC Big Data Health Science Center, a USC excellence initiative program [Grant No: BDHSC-2021-14].

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions.

In civil and environmental engineering education, analytical simulation models help students to understand the processes. MATLAB (c)-based simulation method is proposed in this paper, to enhance learning of students of contaminant migration phenomena, and the simulation program is written by the students within the course based on an existing analytical solution for two-dimensional transport of contaminants in a saturated soil layer. Students use systematic, step-by-step problem solving approach while identifying, formulating and solving the contaminant migration problem. The program is written for pulse source and includes advective and dispersive transport as well as sorption and the simulation is used to obtain the profiles of contaminant concentration as a function of distance from the source and time for a steady groundwater velocity. It is shown that the contaminant concentration profiles obtained by simulation demonstrate the processes involved, by this way, the software tool integrates with the rest of the course content. It was seen by the author that, almost all of the students, who are taking Environmental Geotechnology course, could write matlab codes for contaminant migration if guided properly by the instructor/assistant. In this regard, it seems important to conduct studies which will allow students to increase their matlab programming practice. Also the use of the computer simulation encourages the students to ask what if questions and to carry out parametric studies and to learn by discovery.;"[Cokca, Erdal; Aktas, Tugce] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, K1 Bldg 301, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey";Middle East Technical University;Çokça, E (corresponding author), Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, K1 Bldg 301, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.;ecokca@metu.edu.tr;Çokça, Erdal/AAR-8409-2020;"Çokça, Erdal/0000-0001-8367-2539; Aktas Engin, Tugce/0000-0002-8985-922X";;;;;17;1;1;0;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

In this model, creativity class sessions are followed by two comprehensive and rather challenging multi-week homework assignments of MATLAB problems and projects in electromagnetic fields. This is enabled by a unique and extremely comprehensive collection of MATLAB computer exercises and projects, reinforcing all important theoretical concepts, methodologies, and problem-solving techniques in electromagnetic fields and waves, developed by one of the faculty team members. These tutorials, exercises, and codes constitute a modern tool for learning electromagnetics via computer-mediated exploration and inquiry, exploiting the technological and pedagogical power of MATLAB software as a general learning technology. The novel approach introduces students to MATLAB programming of electromagnetic fields, as opposed to just passive demonstrations of MATLAB's tools and capabilities for computation and visualization of fields. MATLAB programming tutorials and assignments are designed to deepen student engagement and accommodate different learning styles so students can learn more effectively. In addition to improving students' understanding and command of MATLAB use and programming within the electromagnetics context and beyond, these exercises increase their motivation to learn and appreciation of the practical relevance of the material, and equip them with the tools and skills to excel in other courses and projects. The results of this project were qualitatively analyzed through feedback surveys given to the students at the end of each MATLAB assignment.

A multi-granularity self-analyzing module of the teacher network is designed, which enables the student network to learn knowledge from different teaching patterns. Furthermore, a stable excitation scheme is proposed to train the student under robust supervision. The proposed distillation mechanism can be embedded into different distillation frameworks, which are taken as baselines. Experiments show the mecha-nism improves the accuracy by 0.58% on average and by 1.08% in the best over the baselines, which makes its per-formance superior to the state-of-the-arts. It is also exploited that the student's ability of fine-tuning and robustness to noisy inputs can be improved via the proposed mechanism.

Yet, little research has considered how students purposefully use online case discussions to support problem solving. Using a multiple case study approach, we examined how the content covered in three online discussions supported students' individual problem solving during CBI. Using a modified version of Jonassen's (1997) ill-structured problem-solving framework, we coded all discussion postings to understand individual problem-solving processes. Next, we conducted interviews with six students to gain deeper insights into their participation intentions. Findings revealed while the students collaboratively covered all aspects of the problem-solving process, individually, their approaches did not always cover all phases. Individuals with strong problem-solving presence valued discussions as an important part of the learning process, were willing to invest time engaging in the discussion, and maintained a consistent presence. Additionally, as problem-solving presence decreased, learners' perceived barriers increased.

However, existing programming paradigms and the languages based on them seem far-removed from what end-user programmers would need, especially in the area of Management Information. Objective: To evaluate the understandability of a set of programming constructs based on the spreadsheet metaphor from the point of view of end-user programmers in the context of Management Information. The examined set comprises single assignment with exemplary computations, data-driven iterations, selection by colours, and read-write heads (we refer to this as Board Programming). Method: A series of experiments was performed with students of Management Engineering, split into an experimental group and a control group. Each participant was given a piece of code expressed either with the proposed programming construct (experimental group) or its classical counterpart (control group). Their task was to predict the results. For the purpose of evaluation, the FACT indicators of understandability (First attempt failure rate, Attempt number, Cancellation ratio, prediction Time) were proposed and measured. Results: Three of the four examined features, i.e. single assignment with exemplary computations, data driven iterations, and read-write heads, proved to increase understandability of the chosen programs with regard to three out of the four FACT indicators, and these results were statistically significant. Selection by colours was not as effective as expected: the FACT indicator values were improved by that feature, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The described programming constructs appear to be an interesting option when designing an end-user programming language for domain experts in the field of Management Information.

Prior work showcases the importance of logging statements in operating, understanding and improving software systems. The wide dependence on logs has lead to a new market of log processing and management tools. However, logs are often unstable, i.e., the logging statements that generate logs are often changed without the consideration of other stakeholders, causing sudden failures of log processing tools and increasing the maintenance costs of such tools. We examine the stability of logging statements in four open source applications namely: Liferay, ActiveMQ, Camel and CloudStack. We find that 20-45% of their logging statements change throughout their lifetime. The median number of days between the introduction of a logging statement and the first change to that statement is between 1 and 17 in our studied applications. These numbers show that in order to reduce maintenance effort, developers of log processing tools must be careful when selecting the logging statements on which their tools depend. In order to effectively mitigate the issues that are caused by unstable logging statements, we make an important first step towards determining whether a logging statement is likely to remain unchanged in the future. First, we use a random forest classifier to determine whether a just-introduced logging statement will change in the future, based solely on metrics that are calculated when it is introduced. Second, we examine whether a long-lived logging statement is likely to change based on its change history. We leverage Cox proportional hazards models (Cox models) to determine the change risk of long-lived logging statements in the source code. Through our case study on four open source applications, we show that our random forest classifier achieves a 83-91% precision, a 65-85% recall and a 0.95-0.96 AUC. We find that file ownership, developer experience, log density and SLOC are important metrics in our studied projects for determining the stability of logging statements in both our random forest classifiers and Cox models. Developers can use our approach to determine the risk of a logging statement changing in their own projects, to construct more robust log processing tools, by ensuring that these tools depend on logs that are generated by more stable logging statements.;"[Kabinna, Suhas; Bezemer, Cor-Paul; Syer, Mark D.; Hassan, Ahmed E.] Queens Univ, SAIL, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Shang, Weiyi] Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada";"Queens University - Canada; Concordia University - Canada";Kabinna, S (corresponding author), Queens Univ, SAIL, Kingston, ON, Canada.;"kabinna@cs.queensu.ca; bezemer@cs.queensu.ca; shang@encs.concordia.ca; mdsyer@cs.queensu.ca; ahmed@cs.queensu.ca";"Ali, Ahmed/HOF-4672-2023; Hassan, Ahmed/AAB-7241-2019; KHALIFA, AHMED khalifa/HKF-2246-2023";"KHALIFA, AHMED khalifa/0000-0002-2918-7572; Bezemer, Cor-Paul/0000-0002-0474-5718";;;;;50;59;66;0;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

The standard approach to visualize such settings is ray tracing in four-dimensional spacetimes where the direction of the physical propagation of light is reversed. GeoViS implements this ray tracing principle making use of the Motion4D library that handles the spacetime metrics, the integration of geodesics, and the description of objects defined with respect to local reference frames. In combination with the GeodesicViewer, GeoViS might be a valuable tool for graduate students to get a deeper understanding in the visual effects of special and general relativity.

The recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) for various image understanding tasks makes it a promising method for feature extraction. However, limited variability in small-scale datasets leads to systems derived from the direct training or fine-tuning not transferable and unreliable for practical biometric applications. This motivates the design of a multi-weighted co-occurrence descriptor encoding (MWCDE) model for vein recognition. Instead of directly conducting a feed-forward operation with a pre-trained CNN for obtaining the semantic features from the fully connected layers, co-occurrence features among convolutional filters are modeled first in MWCDE by a simple convolution between an indicator filter in a higher layer with a to-be-reweighted filter in a lower layer, and a redundancy-driven indicator filter selection algorithm is designed for filtering out some ambiguous representations. Second, another hard feature weighting strategy with a binary masking scheme is proposed for discarding noisy background and feature redundancy. The selected high-order descriptors are then embedded and aggregated into the compact feature vectors with a saliency driven spatial weighted Fisher vector algorithm, followed by the introduction of a generalized support vector machine for recognition. Extensive experiments with three benchmark vein datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art results, and an additional experiment with the PolyU multispectral palmprint database illustrates its generalization ability.

Few tools exist to explore this complex phenomenon in-depth from a teacher or pre-service teacher perspective. Importantly, pre-service teacher perceptions of cyberbullying may have a significant impact on how pre-service teachers respond to issues of cyberbullying. Pre-service teachers (n = 61) participated in a five-phase online project to develop knowledge and understanding of resources and responses to cyberbullying. First, this article provides a short scan of the literature to contextualize current understandings of the issue and explore different responses to cyberbullying. The literature was analysed using a constant comparison method to search for and identify current and emerging themes. Out of this work, the researchers developed a Cyberbullying Conceptual Framework, which can be used as a tool to investigate cyberbullying. The framework provides key elements for identifying, managing, and preventing cyberbullying. These elements represent a template to guide researchers and educators in exploring cyberbullying from a conceptual, practical, and research basis. Second, the framework is used as a lens to analyse pre-service teachers' online discussions. Each of the pre-service teachers' online posts were coded against the Cyberbullying Conceptual Framework to examine pre-service teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying. Two factors were evident from the study: 1) The online project provided an opportunity for students to develop greater awareness and confidence in identifying, managing, and preventing cyberbullying; and 2) the framework provided a structure to unpack the complex phenomenon of cyberbullying and the meta-language to begin constructive conversations about addressing the issue. Finally, the article concludes with implications for teacher education programs.";"[Redmond, Petrea; Smart, Victoria] Univ Southern Queensland, West St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Lock, Jennifer V.] Univ Calgary, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada";"University of Southern Queensland; University of Calgary";Redmond, P (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, West St, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.;"Petrea.Redmond@usq.edu.au; jvlock@ucalgary.ca; Victoria.Smart@usq.edu.au";Redmond, Petrea/U-4520-2019;"Redmond, Petrea/0000-0001-9674-1206; Lock, Jennifer/0000-0002-0605-9500";;;;;49;16;25;2;48;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Using a qualitative content analysis approach to student and teacher focus group transcripts, this study focuses on student and teacher perceptions of interaction in Virtual Advanced Placement courses across a state in the northeastern United States. Viewed through the lenses of social and teaching presence components of the community of inquiry model, students and teachers perceived the interaction within the course very differently, with teachers reporting largely favorable views of the interaction and students generally viewing the interaction in opposing ways. Results of this study suggest that a fourth presence, learning presence, warrants consideration since without it areas of student experience in online and blended coursework remain unaccounted for. Results of this coding scheme show that we can do more to communicate both the expectations and the process of communication between students and teachers in online and blended coursework, especially at the secondary level.;[Blaine, Andrew M.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Teaching Learning & Educ Leadership, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton";Blaine, AM (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Teaching Learning & Educ Leadership, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.;ablaine@binghamton.edu;Bao, Helen/KHE-1897-2024;;"New York State Education Department; United States Department of Education's Race to the Top initiative; Binghamton University";"New York State Education Department; United States Department of Education's Race to the Top initiative; Binghamton University";The research involved in this study began as a contracted evaluation funded by the New York State Education Department.

J;"Howland, K; Good, J";;;;"Howland, Kate; Good, Judith";;;Learning to communicate computationally with Flip: A bi-modal programming language for game creation;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Evaluation of CAL systems; Interactive learning environments; Programming and programming languages; Secondary education";"THINKING; K-12";Teaching basic computational concepts and skills to school children is currently a curricular focus in many countries. Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11-15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to decode the code. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12-13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Through years of physics learning, the students have had a certain understanding of the basic theories of electromagnetic fields. However, during studying the course, especially the numerical modeling chapter, large-scale mathematical derivations need to be conducted, which significantly enhance the difficulty for students. The cell method (CM) is a newly established numerical method based on the direct derivation of physical laws in cell-complexes, and the physical meanings of the equations are clear and definite. By establishing and applying the education platform based on CM, the students' cognition and mastery of electromagnetic theories and numerical techniques can be deepened substantially. In this paper, the electromagnetic field is mathematically modeled based on CM, and the related transformations in the dual cell complexes are illustrated through the Tonti diagram in class. The simulation platform for electromagnetic fields based on CM is established by coding mathematical models. After teaching the methodologies, students are asked to numerically simulate two static field problems with simple geometric structures by using the methodologies, and the results show that they can better understand and perform in numerically related courses based on CM compared with the performances of former students taught with the finite element method. A questionnaire is utilized to survey the teaching effectiveness, and the students' satisfaction is validated by the questionnaire survey. Finally, the methodologies are employed to analyze the electric and magnetic field of two complex engineering cases, and the students can better understand the use of the numerical methods by analysis. Through the numerical simulations based on CM, the students' ability to apply numerical algorithms to solve complex engineering cases is cultivated, and teaching effectiveness of the numerical analysis chapter in Engineering Electromagnetics is enriched.;"[Zhu, Gaojia; Li, Longnv; Xue, Ming; Liu, Tao] Tiangong Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Adv Technol Elect Engn & Energy, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China";Tiangong University;Xue, M (corresponding author), Tiangong Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Adv Technol Elect Engn & Energy, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.;xueming@tiangong.edu.cn;Zhu, Gaojia/Y-1133-2019;Zhu, Gaojia/0000-0003-2642-2407;"Research Project of the Degree and the Graduate Education Reform of Tiangong University [Y20180108]; Scientific Research Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Commission [2018KJ209]";"Research Project of the Degree and the Graduate Education Reform of Tiangong University; Scientific Research Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Commission";"Research Project of the Degree and the Graduate Education Reform of Tiangong University, Grant/Award Number: Y20180108; Scientific Research Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Commission, Grant/Award Number: 2018KJ209";;20;1;1;0;20;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

It has been proposed as a construct to evaluate the usability of learning technologies at the classroom level, in the same way that cognitive load is used as a measure of usability at the individual level. However, so far this notion has remained abstract. In order to ground orchestration load in empirical evidence and study it in a more systematic and detailed manner, we propose a method to quantify it, based on physiological data (concretely, mobile eye-tracking measures), along with human-coded behavioral data. This paper presents the results of applying this method to four exploratory case studies, where four teachers orchestrated technology-enhanced face-to-face lessons with primary, secondary school, and university students. The data from these studies provide a first validation of this method in different conditions, and illustrate how it can be used to understand the effect of different classroom factors on orchestration load.

At the same time, tools such as augmented reality (AR) are becoming increasingly important with the realization of Industry 5.0 to make data and processes more tangible. Placing the two together paves the way for a new method of active learning and also for an interesting and engaging way of presenting industry processes. It also enables students to reinforce their understanding of the fundamental concepts of fluid dynamics in an interactive way. However, this is not really being utilized yet. For this reason, in this paper, we aim to combine these two powerful tools. Furthermore, we present the framework of a modular open-source library for scientific visualization of fluid flow OpenVisFlow which simplifies the creation of such applications and enables seamless visualization without other software by allowing users to integrate the visualization step into the simulation code.

Algorithms have been proposed to mitigate the above contradiction. However, we still lack an understanding of how the value bias impact performance and a method for efficient exploration while keeping stable updates. This study aims to clarify the effect of the value bias and improve the reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance sample efficiency. Methods: This study designs a simple episodic tabular MDP to research value underestimation and overestimation in actor-critic methods. This study proposes a unified framework called Realistic Actor-Critic (RAC), which employs Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA) to simultaneously learn policies with different value confidence-bound with the same neural network, each with a different under overestimation trade-off. Results: This study highlights that agents could over-explore low-value states due to inflexible under-overestimation trade-off in the fixed hyperparameters setting, which is a particular form of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. And RAC performs directed exploration without over-exploration using the upper bounds while still avoiding overestimation using the lower bounds. Through carefully designed experiments, this study empirically verifies that RAC achieves 10x sample efficiency and 25% performance improvement compared to Soft Actor-Critic in the most challenging Humanoid environment.

The introduction of the European Union's (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 will have far-reaching effects on data scientists and researchers who use BBD, not only in the EU, but around the world. Consequently, many companies are struggling to comply with the Regulation. At the same time, academics interested in research collaborations with companies are finding it more difficult to obtain data. In light of the importance of BBD in both industry and academia, data scientists and behavioral researchers would benefit from a deeper understanding of the GDPR's key concepts, definitions, and principles, especially as they apply to the data science workflow.

We applied informatics methods from expert suggestion systems to a challenging clinical problem: generating personalized nutrition goals from patient-generated diet and blood glucose data. Materials and methods: We applied qualitative process coding and decision tree modeling to understand how registered dietitians translate patient-generated data into recommendations for dietary self-management of diabetes (i.e., knowledge model). We encoded this process in a set of functions that take diet and blood glucose data as an input and output diet recommendations (i.e., inference engine). Dietitians assessed face validity. Using four patient datasets, we compared our inference engine's output to clinical narratives and gold standards developed by expert clinicians. Results: To dietitians, the knowledge model represented how recommendations from patient data are made. Inference engine recommendations were 63 % consistent with the gold standard (range = 42 %-75 %) and 74 % consistent with narrative clinical observations (range = 63 %-83 %). Discussion: Qualitative modeling and automating how dietitians reason over patient data resulted in a knowledge model representing clinical knowledge. However, our knowledge model was less consistent with gold standard than narrative clinical recommendations, raising questions about how best to evaluate approaches that integrate patient-generated data with expert knowledge. Conclusion: New informatics approaches that integrate data-driven methods with expert decision making for personalized goal setting, such as the knowledge base and inference engine presented here, demonstrate the potential to extend the reach of patient-generated data by synthesizing it with clinical knowledge. However, important questions remain about the strengths and weaknesses of computer algorithms developed to discern signal from patient-generated data compared to human experts.";"[Burgermaster, Marissa] Univ Texas Austin, Nutr Sci & Populat Hlth, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Burgermaster, Marissa; Son, Jung H.; Kuperman, Gilad; Feller, Daniel J.; Levine, Matthew E.; Albers, David J.; Weng, Chunhua; Mamykina, Lena] Columbia Univ, Biomed Informat, New York, NY USA; [Davidson, Patricia G.] West Chester Univ, Nutr, W Chester, PA USA; [Smaldone, Arlene M.] Columbia Univ, Sch Nursing, New York, NY USA; [Smaldone, Arlene M.] Columbia Univ, Coll Dent Med, New York, NY USA; [Kuperman, Gilad] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Burt, Katherine Gardner] Lehman Coll, Hlth Sci, Bronx, NY USA; [Albers, David J.] Univ Colorado, Pediat & Informat, Aurora, CO USA";"University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Columbia University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); West Chester University of Pennsylvania; Columbia University; Columbia University; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Lehman College (CUNY); University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus";Burgermaster, M (corresponding author), 1400 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Austin, TX 78723 USA.;marissa.burgermaster@austin.utexas.edu;;Burt, Kate/0000-0002-6115-6450;"National Library of Medicine [NLM007079]; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [RWJF 73070]";"National Library of Medicine(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM)); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF))";This work was funded in part by the National Library of Medicine (NLM007079) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF 73070).;;59;8;10;2;14;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;1386-5056;1872-8243;;INT J MED INFORM;Int.

For the stabilization of the plant, students are guided to execute the essential stages of control system design, from system modeling and parameter optimization, over basic or advanced control strategy design in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, to both implementation and validation of the closed loop on the real robot. To demonstrate and foster the application of fuzzy logic, the second part of the paper introduces a simple control strategy based on fuzzy logic controllers. Then, a lookup table-based implementation technique is described for the demonstration of manual interfacing and embedded coding of fuzzy control strategies.

On the other hand, embedded systems such as Arduino are executed in a hardware-based environment and their verification is conducted by manually checking the operation of the hardware. Therefore, it is not easy to automatically judge the Arduino system developed by students. In the embedded system, hardware and software have to be developed at the same time, and it increases effort and time for the instructors to teach students, especially in practice-based learning. The study in this article proposes an Arduino practice judgment system based on the function execution log in virtual execution environment. It performs both Fritzing-based hardware configuration checking and source code testing based on virtual execution environment, where hardware operations are replaced by mock-up functions. In addition, more diverse practices are possible by providing an experimental environment where students can freely enter input data and check the results. A case study shows that the developed system can be applied to the lectures and help reduce instructors' work and increase students' understanding through the system.;"[Seo, Kangbok; Lee, Woojin] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea; [Kim, Junhyung] Yeungnam Univ, Coll Sci & Technol, Daegu, South Korea";"Kyungpook National University (KNU); Yeungnam University";Lee, WJ (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.;woojin@knu.ac.kr;;;"This research was supported by the BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) funded by the Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea (4199990214394) and the B [4199990214394]; BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) - Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea [NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025109]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Ministry of Education";"This research was supported by the BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) funded by the Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea (4199990214394) and the B; BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) - Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea)";This research was supported by the BK21 FOUR project (AI-driven Convergence Software Education Research Program) funded by the Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea (4199990214394) and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025109).;;27;0;0;1;8;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

We consider IRT to be a rigorous validation tool and apply it to a CT concepts test for primary education involving 13,670 students. A two-parameter logistic model was chosen over other IRT models, as it indicated an acceptable model fit and item fit. The discrimination parameters indicated that the instrument could effectively distinguish between students with various ability levels. Nominal response modelling in IRT was used to retrieve information from the students' responses, and those with a lower ability level were found to only consider one of the conditions provided, had no understanding of the repetition structure, and might have difficulties in associating a sprite with its corresponding codes. Based on ability estimates, we also found that the students' ability in terms of CT concepts increased with grades and that boys generally performed slightly better than girls.

Due to the knowledge of which frequencies correspond to which image characteristics, we can efficiently solve tasks such as smoothing, edge detection, regular pattern detection or removal, and image compression. Therefore, understanding of basic principles is of great importance for people working in fields requiring signal and image processing knowledge and skills. The key link between the standard image domain and frequency domain is provided by the well-known Fourier transform. Even though this transform is commonly understood as a standard framework for frequency analysis, proper understanding of its fundamentals is often hindered by many people's preoccupation with complex numbers and trigonometric functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel application called FTutor. It aims to serve as an interactive guide for those who are beginning to learn about the Fourier transform and want to properly understand its principles. In particular, FTutor is designed for use by the students and teachers of image processing courses to simplify and ease the process of understanding the frequency domain.

In this work, a course that addresses digital tools in pharmaceutical manufacturing for chemical engineers was adjusted to utilize a new tool, PharmaPy, instead of traditional chemical engineering simulation tools. Jupyter Notebook was utilized as an instructional and interactive environment to teach students to use PharmaPy, a new, open-source pharmaceutical manufacturing process simulator. Students were then surveyed to see if PharmaPy was able to meet the learning objectives of the course.

The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students' chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults.;[Reynolds, Rebecca B.] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA;"Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick";Reynolds, RB (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, 4 Huntington St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.;Rebecca.reynolds@rutgers.edu;Gutierrez-Braojos, Calixto CGB/M-8602-2015;Reynolds, Rebecca/0000-0001-7355-0992;Institute for Museum and Library Services through the IMLS 'Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program Early Career Development Program';Institute for Museum and Library Services through the IMLS 'Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program Early Career Development Program';The author thanks the Institute for Museum and Library Services for their funding and support of this project through the IMLS 'Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program Early Career Development Program'.;;68;19;24;2;79;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0165-5515;1741-6485;;J INF SCI;J.

There is substantial existing research studying industrial use and technical challenges of modelling. However, there is a lack of detailed empirical work investigating how students perceive modelling.AimWe investigate the perceptions of students towards modelling in a university environment.MethodWe conducted a multiple case study with 5 cases (5 courses from 3 universities) and two units of analysis (student and instructor). We collected data through 21 semi-structured interviews, which we analysed using in-vivo coding and thematic analysis.ResultsStudents see some benefits of modelling, e.g., using models for planning and communicating within the group. However, several factors negatively influence their understanding of modelling, e.g., assignments with unclear expectations, irregular and insufficient feedback on their models, and lack of experience with the problem domains.ConclusionsOur findings help in understanding better why students struggle with software modelling, and might be reluctant to adopt it later on. Our recommendations on modelling education could help to improve education and training in software modelling, both at university and in industry. Specifically, we recommend that educators try to provide feedback beyond syntactical issues, and to consider using problem domains that students are knowledgeable about.;"[Chakraborty, Shalini; Liebel, Grischa] Reykjavik Univ, Sch Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Menntavegur 1, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland";Reykjavik University;Liebel, G (corresponding author), Reykjavik Univ, Sch Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Menntavegur 1, IS-102 Reykjavik, Iceland.;"shalini19@ru.is; grischal@ru.is";;Liebel, Grischa/0000-0002-3884-815X;;;;;57;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

What types of active learning is garnered from such educational technologies, among secondary aged science learners, was the focus of the study. By using open-ended questioning and the active learning framework by Chi (2009), this research study collected students' questions they had about the science content which was then categorized inductively and deductively by active processes (activation of prior knowledge), constructive processes (garnering new knowledge), and interactive processes (creating new understandings beyond the scope of the curriculum). Results from coding questions from 151 secondary students (75 in sixth grade and 76 in ninth grade) revealed significance in sixth graders' abilities to progress from active processes to the higher and more sophisticated learning processes; significant changes were found among ninth graders to progress from active to constructive processes and from constructive to interactive learning processes.

Studying this impact would help to understand how much technical debt interest is being paid due to the existence of architecture smells and how this interest can be calculated. This work is a first attempt to address this issue by investigating the relation between architecture smells and source code changes. Specifically, we study whether the frequency and size of changes are correlated with the presence of a selected set of architectural smells. We detect architectural smells using the Arcan tool, which detects architectural smells by building a dependency graph of the system analyzed and then looking for the typical structures of the architectural smells. The findings, based on a case study of 31 open-source Java systems, show that 87% of the analyzed commits present more changes in artifacts with at least one smell, and the likelihood of changing increases with the number of smells. Moreover, there is also evidence to confirm that change frequency increases after the introduction of a smell and that the size of changes is also larger in smelly artifacts. These findings hold true especially in Medium-Large and Large artifacts.;"[Sas, Darius; Avgeriou, Paris] Univ Groningen, Bernoulli Inst Math Comp Sci & Artificial Intelli, Groningen, Netherlands; [Pigazzini, Ilaria; Fontana, Francesca Arcelli] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Informat Syst & Commun, Milan, Italy";"University of Groningen; University of Milano-Bicocca";Sas, D (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Fac Sci & Engn FSE, Nijenborgh 9, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.;d.d.sas@rug.nl;;"Sas, Darius/0000-0003-3383-3298; Avgeriou, Paris/0000-0002-7101-0754";"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [780572]; Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland [17038]";"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(Horizon 2020); Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland(Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO))";"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, Grant/Award Number: 780572; Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland, Grant/Award Number: 17038";;38;3;4;1;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2047-7473;2047-7481;;J SOFTW-EVOL PROC;J.

Considering the potential role of metacognition and KB in promoting conducive epistemic emotions, we designed a quasi-experiment and examined the influence of collaborative analytics-enhanced reflective assessment (demonstrate metacognition) on conducive epistemic emotions to students' KB. The experimental class included 48 undergraduates engaged in KB inquiries enhanced by collaborative analytics-enhanced reflective assessment. In contrast, the comparison class included 46 undergraduates engaged in KB enhanced by portfolio assessment. Students' online Knowledge Forum discourse was collected and coded regarding the demonstrated epistemic emotions. Comparative analysis of the frequency distribution and lag sequential patterns of epistemic emotions revealed that the collaborative analytics-enhanced reflective assessment design fostered conducive epistemic emotions to KB among the undergraduates. Correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between conducive epistemic emotions, higher-level KB discourse moves, and individual knowledge creation. The findings enrich our understanding of promoting undergraduates' conducive epistemic emotions and uncover the relationships between metacognition, epistemic emotions, and KB practices. It provides implications for developing a reflective and collaborative culture, providing scaffoldings and opportunities for expressing and analyzing epistemic emotions, utilizing prompt sheets and collective reflections to enhance the productive use of analytics, and fostering a conducive emotional experience for students.;"[Yang, Yuqin] Cent China Normal Univ, Fac Artifcial Intelligence Educ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Gaoxia] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ NIE, Singapore, Singapore; [Jiao, Lizhen] Tsinghua Univ, Informat Technol Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Kaicheng] Jiangsu Xishan Sr High Sch, Xixi Branch, Wuxi Jiangsu, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Gaoxia] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ NIE, Learning Sci & Assessment Acad Grp, Singapore, Singapore";"Central China Normal University; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Tsinghua University; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore";Zhu, GX (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ NIE, Learning Sci & Assessment Acad Grp, Singapore, Singapore.;"yangyuqin@ccnu.edu.cn; yuankaicheng1998@163.com; gaoxia.zhu@nie.edu.sg; jiaolz@tsinghua.edu.cn";Gutierrez-Braojos, Calixto CGB/M-8602-2015;Zhu, Gaoxia/0000-0003-4589-0775;"National Natural Science Foundation of the People's Republic of China [62107020]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [21YJA880078]; University-Level Educational Reformation Research Projects of Central China Normal University [CCNUTEIII 2021-11, CCNUAI FE2022-03-15]";"National Natural Science Foundation of the People's Republic of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China); University-Level Educational Reformation Research Projects of Central China Normal University";This research is supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of the People's Republic of China (Grant No. 62107020) , Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (Grant No. 21YJA880078) , and University-Level Educational Reformation Research Projects (CCNUTEIII 2021-11, CCNUAI & FE2022-03-15) of Central China Normal University.;;73;2;2;25;35;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

In the case of information systems-related courses, students focus on system development using specific languages and frameworks while often disregard the required logical checks and constraints. This paper introduces annotated functional decomposition (AFD) to assist students in overcoming the challenge of understanding the logic of an information system. AFD leverages methodological concepts from computational thinking and represents a problem decomposition approach that is extended with additional levels of decomposition. These levels of decomposition are orthogonal and implemented with annotations that enrich a decomposition with information regarding control and data flow, as well as reuse and implementation details. AFD could be exercised with a supporting AFD Tool developed as an Eclipse IDE plugin that performs syntax and semantic checks along with the generation of UML sequential diagrams. The AFD Tool and its source code are available free of charge. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of AFD Tool usage during an information systems course revealed that students who used AFD achieved higher average grades than those who used UML for solving the same problems, and moreover that students perceived AFD as easy to understand and use.;"[Tubic, Stefan; Cvetanovic, Milos; Radivojevic, Zaharije; Stojanovic, Sasa] Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Comp Engn & Informat, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade 11120, Serbia";University of Belgrade;Tubic, S (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Sch Elect Engn, Comp Engn & Informat, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, Belgrade 11120, Serbia.;stefan.tubic@etf.bg.ac.rs;;;"Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III44009, TR32047]";"Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)";"Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, Grant/Award Number: AVANTES; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, Grant/Award Numbers: III44009, TR32047";;19;2;2;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

However, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of such datasets so that the insights they provide are accurate and useful. The aim of this study was to identify data inconsistencies within the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) dataset for autistic patients and assess potential biases introduced through these inconsistencies and their impact on patient outcomes. The study can only identify inconsistencies in recording of autism diagnosis and not whether the inclusion or exclusion of the autism diagnosis is the error. Methods: Data were extracted from the HES database for the period 1st April 2013 to 31st March 2021 for pa-tients with a diagnosis of autism. First spells in hospital during the study period were identified for each patient and these were linked to any subsequent spell in hospital for the same patient. Data inconsistencies were recorded where autism was not recorded as a diagnosis in a subsequent spell. Features associated with data inconsistencies were identified using a random forest classifiers and regression modelling.Results: Data were available for 172,324 unique patients who had been recorded as having an autism diagnosis on first admission. In total, 43.7 % of subsequent spells were found to have inconsistencies. The features most strongly associated with inconsistencies included greater age, greater deprivation, longer time since the first spell, change in provider, shorter length of stay, being female and a change in the main specialty description. The random forest algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.864 (95 % CI [0.862 - 0.866]) in predicting a data inconsistency. For patients who died in hospital, inconsistencies in their final spell were significantly associated with being 80 years and over, being female, greater deprivation and use of a palliative care code in the death spell.Conclusions: Data inconsistencies in the HES database were relatively common in autistic patients and were associated a number of patient and hospital admission characteristics. Such inconsistencies have the potential to distort our understanding of service use in key demographic groups.;"[Heyl, Johannes; Hardy, Flavien; Hopper, Adrian; Day, Jamie; Wheeler, Andrew; Eve-Jones, Sue; Briggs, Tim W.

Our hypothesis is that a more open-ended approach to teaching programming, characterized by both creativity and self-reflection, would improve learning outcomes among our cohort of aspiring HCI practitioners. The objective of our design-led action research was to determine how to effectively embed open-endedness, student-led teaching, and self-reflection into an online programming class. Each of these notions has been studied separately before, but there is a dearth of published work into their actual design and implementation in practice. In service of that objective we present our contribution in two parts: a qualitatively-derived understanding of student attitudes toward open-ended blended learning, as well as a matching set of design principles for future open-ended HCI education. The project was motivated by a search for better educational outcomes, both in terms of student coding self-efficacy and quantitative metrics of cohort performance (e.g., failure rates). The first year programming course within our interaction design-focussed Bachelors program has had the highest failure rate of any core unit for over a decade. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic confounded any year-to-year quantitative comparison of the learning efficacy of our successive prototypes. There is simply no way to fairly compare the experiences of pre-pandemic and pandemic-affected student cohorts. However, the experience of teaching this material in face-to-face, fully online, and hybrid modalities throughout the pandemic has aided our qualitative exploration of why open-ended learning helps some students but seems to harm others. Through three sets of student interviews, platform data, and insights gained from both the instructional and platform design process, we show that open-ended learning can empower students, but can also exacerbate fears and anxieties around inadequacy and failure. Through seven semesters of iterating on our designs, interviewing students and reflecting on our interventions, we've developed a set of classroom-validated design principles for teaching programming to HCI students without strong computational backgrounds.;"[Grace, Kazjon; Klaassens, Brittany; Bray, Liam; Elton-Pym, Alex] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Design Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia";University of Sydney;Grace, K (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Design Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;kazjon.grace@sydney.edu.au;;Bray, Liam/0000-0003-0620-2490;"University of Sydney; initiation of the project through a 2018 Strategic Education Innovation award; School of Architecture, Design and Planning";"University of Sydney(University of Sydney); initiation of the project through a 2018 Strategic Education Innovation award; School of Architecture, Design and Planning";We acknowledge the support, both financial and advisory, of the Education Innovation Team at the University of Sydney, particularly Dr Jessica Frawley.

J;Patterson, B;;;;Patterson, Blain;;;Analyzing student understanding of cryptography using the SOLO taxonomy;CRYPTOLOGIA;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Pedagogy; qualitative research; SOLO taxonomy";;Although cryptography is monumentally important in keeping our information safe and secure, this interdisciplinary field of study can also be used as a powerful teaching tool by putting mathematics in a dramatic and realistic setting. Cryptography also allows for a natural way to introduce topics such as modular arithmetic, matrix operations, and elementary group theory. This paper reports the results of a preliminary qualitative study of students' thinking and understanding of cryptography using both the SOLO taxonomy and open coding as they participated in task-based interviews. Students interviewed were assessed on how they made connections to various areas of mathematics through solving cryptography problems. Analyzing these interviews showed that students have a strong foundation in number-theoretic concepts such as divisibility and modular arithmetic. Also, students were able to use probability intuitively to make sense of and solve problems. Finally, participants' SOLO levels ranged from uni-structural to extended abstract, with the multi-structural level being the most common (three participants). This gives evidence to suggest that students should be given the opportunity to make mathematical connections early and often in their academic careers. Results indicate that although cryptography need not be a required course for mathematics majors, concepts from this field could be introduced in courses such as linear algebra, abstract algebra, number theory, and discrete mathematics.;[Patterson, Blain] Virginia Mil Inst, Dept Appl Math, Lexington, VA 24450 USA;;Patterson, B (corresponding author), Virginia Mil Inst, Dept Appl Math, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.;pattersonba@vmi.edu;;;;;;;16;1;1;3;28;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0161-1194;1558-1586;;CRYPTOLOGIA;Cryptologia;SEP 3;2021;45;5;;;;;439;449;;10.1080/01611194.2020.1755746;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01611194.2020.1755746;;MAY 2020;11;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; History & Philosophy Of Science; Mathematics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; History & Philosophy of Science; Mathematics";UK8YG;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000534895200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The introduction of the electronic health record (EHR) has been a key component in shaping not only organization, clinical workflow and ultimately physicians' clinical decision making, but also patient-physician communication in the medical office. In order to inform the design of future EHR interfaces and assess their impact on patient-centered healthcare, designers and researchers must understand the multimodal nature of the complex physician-patient-EHR system interaction. However, characterizing multimodal activity is difficult and expensive, often requiring manual coding of hours of video data. We present our Lab-in-a-Box solution that enables the capture of multimodal activity in real-world settings. We focus here on the medical office where our Lab-in-a-Box system exploits a range of sensors to track computer-based activity, speech interaction, visual attention and body movements, and automatically synchronize and segment this data. The fusion of multiple sensors allows us to derive initial activity segmentation and to visualize it for further interactive analysis. By empowering researchers with cutting-edge data collection tools and accelerating analysis of multimodal activity in the medical office, our Lab-in-a-Box has the potential to uncover important insights and inform the next generation of Health IT systems.;"[Weibel, Nadir; Rick, Steven; Emmenegger, Colleen; Agha, Zia] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weibel, Nadir; Rick, Steven; Ashfaq, Shazia; Calvitti, Alan] HSRD VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, Vet Affairs Med Res Fdn, San Diego, CA 92161 USA; [Agha, Zia] West Hlth Inst, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Diego; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA San Diego Healthcare System";Weibel, N (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;"weibel@ucsd.edu; srick@ucsd.edu; emmenegger@ucsd.edu; shazia.ashfaq@va.gov; alan.calvitti@va.gov; zagha@westhealth.org";;"Rick, Steven/0000-0001-9739-316X; Weibel, Nadir/0000-0002-3457-4227";"AHRQ Grant [1 R01 HS021290-01A1]; Zia Agha PI";"AHRQ Grant; Zia Agha PI";This research was funded by AHRQ Grant 1 R01 HS021290-01A1, Zia Agha PI.

Further, makerspaces have been shown to be highly gendered, privileging men's and masculine understandings of making. The spike in popularity warrants deeper analysis, examining the value of these spaces for women and if learning is occurring in these spaces, specifically at higher education institutions. We implemented a phenomenologically based interviewing process to capture the making experiences of 20 women students, recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. By eliciting the narratives of women students, we captured how making, designing, and creating evolved through gendered experiences in the university makerspace. Each interview was transcribed and resulted in around 868 pages of single-spaced text transcriptions. The data were analyzed through multiple cycles of open and axial coding for common themes and patterns, where makerspaces create a culture of learning, facilitate students' design journey, and form a laboratory for creativity. These themes forwarded the creation of a learning model that showcases how design and learning interact in the makerspace.

Online media outlets have often been popular Web destinations and so they are expected to be at the forefront of innovation, both in terms of the integration of new technologies and in terms of the evolution of their interfaces. In this study, various Web data extraction techniques were employed to collect current and archival data from news websites that are popular in Greece, in order to monitor and record their progress through time. This collected information, which took the form of a website's source code and an impression of their homepage in different time instances of the last decade, has been used to identify trends concerning Semantic Web integration, DOM structure complexity, number of graphics, color usage, and more. The identified trends were analyzed and discussed with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the ever-changing presence of the media industry on the Web.

Design/methodology/approach The primary method used for this investigation was an online crowdsourced survey of 105 participants who attended two and four-year colleges in the USA. The questionnaire used free word association where participants shared information barriers encountered on colleges' campuses. Responses from each questionnaire were interpreted using open coding. Findings Information barriers around sexuality continue to be a challenge for non- heteronormative information seekers on college campuses. One-third of students had distinctive information needs around their sexuality and experienced information barriers from both the institution and social stigma. The study reveals an evolution in sexual minority students' sense of self, which has moved beyond the binary identity of gay/lesbian explored in previous studies; students identified bisexuality as a salient information need, and described a campus environment that often erased bisexuality. The academic library was described as an information barrier due to inadequate sexual minority-related resources. Originality/value A limited number of studies in information science have focused on sexual minority college students' information behaviors and even fewer on information barriers.

Part of the Australian response was a robust primary care approach, involving changes to care models (including telehealth) and the widespread use of data to inform the changes. This paper outlines how a large primary care database responded to provide real-time data to inform policy and practice. Simply extracting the data is not sufficient. Understanding the data is. The POpulation Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) program is designed to use GP data for multiple objectives and is built on a pre-existing engagement framework established over a fifteen-year period. Initially developed to provide QA activities for general practices and population level data for General Practice support organisations, the POLAR platform has demonstrated the critical ability to design and deploy real-time data analytics solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic for a variety of stakeholders including state and federal government agencies. Methods: The system extracts and processes data from over 1,300 general practices daily. Data is de-identified at the point of collection and encrypted before transfer. Data cleaning for analysis uses a variety of techniques, including Natural Language Processing and coding of free text information. The curated dataset is then distilled into several analytic solutions designed to address specific areas of investigation of interest to various stakeholders. One such analytic solution was a model we created that used multiple data inputs to rank patient geographic areas by the likelihood of a COVID-19 outbreak. The model utilised pathology ordering, COVID-19 related diagnoses, indication of COVID-19 related concern (via progress notes) and also incorporated state based actual confirmed case figures. Results: Using the methods described, we were able to deliver real-time data feeds to practices, Primary Health Networks (PHN) and other agencies. In addition, we developed a COVID-19 geographic risk stratification based on local government areas (LGAs) to pro-actively inform the primary care response. Providing PHNs with a list of geographic priority hotspots allowed for better targeting and response of Personal Protective Equipment allocation and pop-up clinic placement. Conclusions: The program summarised here demonstrates the ability of a well-designed system underpinned by accurate and reliable data, to respond in real-time to a rapidly evolving public health emergency in a way which supports and enhances the health system response.;"[Pearce, Christopher] Monash Univ, Res, Outcome Hlth, 1 Chapel St, Blackburn 3130, Australia; [Pearce, Christopher] Monash Univ, Gen Practice, 1 Chapel St, Blackburn 3130, Australia; [McLeod, Adam; Gardner, Karina; Ferrigi, Jason] Outcome Hlth, Blackburn, Australia; [Supple, Jamie] Outcome Hlth, Business Intelligence, Blackburn, Australia; [Proposch, Amanda] Gippsland Primary Hlth Network, Traralgon, Vic, Australia";"Monash University; Monash University";"Pearce, C (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Res, Outcome Hlth, 1 Chapel St, Blackburn 3130, Australia.;Pearce, C (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Gen Practice, 1 Chapel St, Blackburn 3130, Australia.";drchrispearce@mac.com;Nasarian, Elham/ISB-6863-2023;;;;;;26;2;2;0;10;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;1386-5056;1872-8243;;INT J MED INFORM;Int.

However, whether this theoretical concept exists in practice remains contentious. To ascertain the nature of TPACK, the present study aimed to understand how six pre-service English teachers enacted various forms of TPACK through design thinking while considering contextual problems that impacted on their web-conferencing teaching over the course of 14 weeks. This study examined the design conversations in which six distance teachers discussed ways to design online teaching materials and activities as well as to solve any contextual problems encountered. Through quantitative content analysis of coded post teaching discussions and qualitative analysis of interviews, it was found that while the teachers' discussions conspicuously displayed an orientation towards Pedagogical Content Knowledge, as opposed to technology-based knowledge, their discussions were particularly not associated with Technological Pedagogical Knowledge. In addition, two contextual factors were found to influence their web-conferencing teaching: technical problems related to sound quality were identified as a micro-level contextual factor while the teachers' concerns about their students' prior knowledge and short attention spans were viewed as a student-centric contextual factor. These findings provide insights into how individual TPACK subdomains were enacted through design thinking that enabled the teachers to overcome contextual problems. The present study contributes to our understanding of how TPACK enactment is mediated by the context, empirically validating TPACK construct in practice through design thinking.;"[Tseng, Jun-Jie; Cheng, Yuh-Show; Yeh, Hsi -Nan] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept English, 162,Sect 1,Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan";National Taiwan Normal University;Tseng, JJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept English, 162,Sect 1,Heping E Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;"jjtseng@ntnu.edu.tw; t22035@ntnu.edu.tw; brianyeh@ntnu.edu.tw";Tseng, Jun-Jie/I-7652-2019;Tseng, Jun-Jie/0000-0003-3738-9657;Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC [105-2410-H-003-075];Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC [grant number 105-2410-H-003-075-];;49;67;80;3;132;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

However, it remains unknown what makes searchers feel the difficulty. A study consisting of 48 undergraduate students was conducted to explore this question. Each participant was given 4 search tasks that were carefully designed following a task classification scheme. Questionnaires were used to elicit participants' ratings on task difficulty and why they gave those ratings. Based on the collected difficulty reasons, a coding scheme was developed, which covered various aspects of task, user, and user-task interaction. Difficulty reasons were then categorized following this scheme. Results showed that searchers reported some common reasons leading to task difficulty in different tasks, but most of the difficulty reasons varied across tasks. In addition, task difficulty had some common reasons between searchers with low and high levels of topic knowledge, although there were also differences in top task difficulty reasons between high and low knowledge users. These findings further our understanding of search task difficulty, the relationship between task difficulty and task type, and that between task difficulty and knowledge level. The findings can also be helpful with designing tasks for information search experiments, and have implications on search system design both in general and for personalization based on task type and searchers' knowledge.

Meanwhile, there are safety issues associated with the use of practical training equipment. To address these problems, this paper developed an instructional system based on mixed-reality (MR) technology for teaching about industrial robots. The Siasun T6A-series robots were taken as a case study, and the Microsoft MR device HoloLens-2 was used as the instructional platform. First, the parameters of the robots were analyzed based on their structural drawings. Then, the robot modules were decomposed, and 1:1 three-dimensional (3D) digital reproductions were created in Maya. Next, a library of digital models of the robot components was established, and a 3D spatial operation interface for the virtual instructional system was created in Unity. Subsequently, a C# code framework was established to satisfy the requirements of interactive functions and data transmission, and the data were saved in JSON format. In this way, a key technique that facilitates the understanding of spatial structures and a variety of human-machine interactions were realized. Finally, an instructional system based on HoloLens-2 was established for understanding the structures and principles of robots. The results showed that the instructional system developed in this study provides realistic 3D visualizations and a natural, efficient approach for human-machine interactions. This system could effectively improve the efficiency of knowledge transfer and the student???s motivation to learn.;"[Li, Guwei; Yang, Yun; Li, Zhou] Zhejiang Dongfang Polytech, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China; [Fan, Jingchun] Compugen Ltd, Toronto, ON M2J 4A6, Canada";;Li, Z (corresponding author), Zhejiang Dongfang Polytech, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China.;2679392892@qq.com;;;;;;;25;1;1;10;29;TECH SCIENCE PRESS;HENDERSON;871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA;1546-2218;1546-2226;;CMC-COMPUT MATER CON;CMC-Comput.

UML diagrams are used in the analysis, construction, and maintenance of software systems. Mostly, UML diagrams capture an abstract view of a (piece of a) software system. A key purpose of UML diagrams is to share knowledge about the system among developers. The quality of the layout of UML diagrams plays a crucial role in their comprehension. In this paper, we present an automated method for evaluating the layout quality of UML class diagrams. We use machine learning based on features extracted from the class diagram images using image processing. Such an automated evaluator has several uses: (1) From an industrial perspective, this tool could be used for automated quality assurance for class diagrams (e.g., as part of a quality monitor integrated into a DevOps toolchain). For example, automated feedback can be generated once a UML diagram is checked in the project repository. (2) In an educational setting, the evaluator can grade the layout aspect of student assignments in courses on software modeling, analysis, and design. (3) In the field of algorithm design for graph layouts, our evaluator can assess the layouts generated by such algorithms. In this way, this evaluator opens up the road for using machine learning to learn good layouting algorithms.Approach. We use machine learning techniques to build (linear) regression models based on features extracted from the class diagram images using image processing. As ground truth, we use a dataset of 600+ UML Class Diagrams for which experts manually label the quality of the layout.Contributions. This paper makes the following contributions:(1) We show the feasibility of the automatic evaluation of the layout quality of UML class diagrams.(2) We analyze which features of UML class diagrams are most strongly related to the quality of their layout.(3) We evaluate the performance of our layout evaluator.(4) We offer a dataset of labeled UML class diagrams. In this dataset, we supply for every diagram the following information: (a) a manually established ground truth of the quality of the layout, (b) an automatically established value for the layout-quality of the diagram (produced by our classifier), and (c) the values of key features of the layout of the diagram (obtained by image processing). This dataset can be used for replication of our study and others to build on and improve on this work.

After the introduction of the deep Q-network, deep RL has been achieving great success. However, the applications of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for image processing are still limited. Therefore, we extend deep RL to pixelRL for various image processing applications. In pixelRL, each pixel has an agent, and the agent changes the pixel value by taking an action. We also propose an effective learning method for pixelRL that significantly improves the performance by considering not only the future states of the own pixel but also those of the neighbor pixels. The proposed method can be applied to some image processing tasks that require pixel-wise manipulations, where deep RL has never been applied. Besides, it is possible to visualize what kind of operation is employed for each pixel at each iteration, which would help us understand why and how such an operation is chosen. We also believe that our technology can enhance the explainability and interpretability of the deep neural networks. In addition, because the operations executed at each pixels are visualized, we can change or modify the operations if necessary. We apply the proposed method to a variety of image processing tasks: image denoising, image restoration, local color enhancement, and saliency-driven image editing. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or better performance, compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on supervised learning.

A possible solution is to design sound technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environments with relevant content and pedagogical tools to reduce teachers' design efforts. Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is a promising framework for understanding how teachers could integrate technologies into classrooms. Scholars have highlighted the repurposing of the framework to inform the design of TEL environments. This study employed the TPACK framework to design the learning environment called 'MyCLOUD'. MyCLOUD advances the integration of mobile and cloud technologies for self-directed, collaborative and seamless Chinese Language learning among primary students. In this paper, we unpack how the distributed TPACK resources among the teachers and the researchers have contributed to the design of the learning environment. The analysis is accomplished through researchers' coding and consolidation of 42 meeting minutes throughout the developmental period, thereby outlining the trajectory of the researcher-teacher co-design of the learning environment as a manifestation of newly created TPACK. This is followed by a study of students' perceived usability of the platform, with all three subscales of the user acceptance survey scoring above the mid-point of 3 in their respective mean values. This research contributes to current development of TEL by using the TPACK framework to widen the design considerations that go beyond what is technologically possible to include what is pedagogically desirable for a specific content learning.;"[Wong, Lung-Hsiang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Chai, Ching Sing] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Learning Sci & Technol Acad Grp, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zhang, Xujuan] First High Sch Changsha Cty, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [King, Ronnel B.] Hong Kong Inst Educ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)";Wong, LH (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, Singapore 639798, Singapore.;"lunghsiang.wong@nie.edu.sg; chingsing.chai@nie.edu.sg; xujuanzhang@gmail.com; ronnelking@gmail.com";"King, Ronnel B/AGZ-0675-2022; Chai, Ching Sing/AFQ-2920-2022; /AAD-1733-2020";"King, Ronnel B/0000-0003-1723-1748; Chai, Ching Sing/0000-0002-6298-4813; /0000-0002-0402-9199; KING, Ronnel Bornasal/0000-0002-0648-8508";Office of Education Research, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [OER 17/10 WLH, OER 61/12 WLH];Office of Education Research, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore(Nanyang Technological University);This work was funded by Office of Education Research, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (Project IDs: OER 17/10 WLH, OER 61/12 WLH).

Augmented immersive reality (AIR) technologies enhance users' perception of reality by augmenting it with computer-generated components such as audio, video, 2/3-D graphics, GPS data, etc. The AIR introduces new dimensions of learning experience that ensure better attention, focus, and entertainment, thereby boosting students' motivation and attainment. This work presents an award winning AIR-based educational mobile system, code-named AIR-EDUTECH, that was developed to help high school students learn chemistry. The AIR-EDUTECH introduced new AIR features to help students better understand and learn basic concepts of molecular chemistry. It offers immersive 3D visualization and visual interaction with the examined structures that provides a broader and more retentive knowledge and improves intuition around forming basic chemical reactions. The system was introduced and tested in a field study with 45 students in the 11th grade chemistry class, and its impact was evaluated by the formal assessment quiz along with the feedback from survey conducted after the trial. Collected data have been subjected to an in-depth multi-modal quantitative analysis that revealed that AIR-EDUTECH stimulated significant improvements in understanding and retention of the taught content as well as turned learning chemistry into a fun, interesting and interactive experience. It also uncovered a hidden structure of taught knowledge dependencies and highlighted the role that AIR technology could play in reinforcing the retention of critical knowledge that may otherwise widen student knowledge gaps.;"[Cen, Ling; Ruta, Dymitr; Al Qassem, Lamees Mahmoud Mohd Said; Ng, Jason] Khalifa Univ, EBTIC, Abu Dhabi 127788, U Arab Emirates";Khalifa University of Science & Technology;Cen, L (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, EBTIC, Abu Dhabi 127788, U Arab Emirates.;"cen.ling@ku.ac.ae; dymitr.ruta@ku.ac.ae; 100037108@ku.ac.ae; jason.ng@ku.ac.ae";Al Qassem, Lamees/AAT-1146-2021;Al Qassem, Lamees/0000-0003-0823-949X;;;;;37;33;33;11;89;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

A challenge of this approach is to reduce the flexibility of the student's representations inducing inaccurate learning of the teacher's knowledge. To resolve the problems, we propose a novel method feature structure distillation that elaborates information on structures of features into three types for transferring, and implements them based on Centered Kernel Analysis. In particular, the global local-inter structure is proposed to transfer the structure beyond the mini-batch. In detail, the method first divides the feature information into three structures: intra-feature, local inter-feature, and global inter-feature structures to subdivide the structure and transfer the diversity of the structure. Then, we adopt CKA which shows a more accurate similarity metric compared to other metrics between two different models or representations on different spaces. In particular, a memory-augmented transfer method with clustering is implemented for the global structures. The methods are empirically analyzed on the nine tasks for language understanding of the GLUE dataset with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is a representative neural language model. In the results, the proposed methods effectively transfer the three types of structures and improves performance compared to state-of-the-art distillation methods: (i.e.) ours achieve 66.61% accuracy compared to the baseline (65.55%) in the RTE dataset.

Although technology and available tools change rapidly, the basic principles remain the same, therefore education should focus on a better understanding of these. On the other hand, it is very important for the future's engineers, developers, and professionals to follow the correct methods, to be reliable, creative, and open to the more and more common interdisciplinary methodology. In this paper, we demonstrate this approach by investigating exciting interdisciplinary phonocardiography and photoplethysmography experiments and related electronics, data acquisition, and signal processing. In our work, we focus on the understanding and applying the correct methods, provide a detailed analysis of common pitfalls and leave room also for additional work. Students and teachers, lecturers can learn what to consider, pick what they find useful for their projects. It is also important to note, that the principles are valid for much other instrumentation and information processing jobs as well.;"[Gingl, Zoltan; Makan, Gergely; Mellar, Janos; Vadai, Gergely; Mingesz, Robert] Univ Szeged, Dept Tech Informat, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary";Szeged University;Gingl, Z (corresponding author), Univ Szeged, Dept Tech Informat, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.;gingl@inf.u-szeged.hu;"Vadai, Gergely/M-2862-2018; Makan, Gergely/L-8312-2018; Gingl, Zoltan/E-8262-2011";"Vadai, Gergely/0000-0002-2720-3380; Makan, Gergely/0000-0001-6648-6371; Mingesz, Robert/0000-0002-4817-5948; Gingl, Zoltan/0000-0001-6570-2685";"Hungarian Academy of Sciences; University of Szeged";"Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); University of Szeged";This work was supported by the Content Pedagogy Research Program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the University of Szeged.;;37;2;2;3;20;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2019;7;;;;;;88970;88985;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926519;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926519;;;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";IK7YW;;gold, Green Accepted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000476810800038;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Zhong, L;;;;Zhong, Liu;;;A convolutional neural network based online teaching method using edge-cloud computing platform;JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Edge calculation; Dance action correction; Grid coding; Key frame extraction";KEY FRAME EXTRACTION;Teaching has become a complex essential tool for students' abilities, due to their different levels of learning and understanding. In the traditional offline teaching methods, dance teachers lack a target for students 'classroom teaching. Furthermore, teachers have limited time, so they cannot take full care of each student's learning needs according to their understanding and learning ability, which leads to the polarization of the learning effect. Because of this, this paper proposes an online teaching method based on Artificial Intelligence and edge calculation. In the first phase, standard teaching and student-recorded dance learning videos are conducted through the key frames extraction through a deep convolutional neural network. In the second phase, the extracted key frame images were then extracted for human key points using grid coding, and the fully convolutional neural network was used to predict the human posture. The guidance vector is used to correct the dance movements to achieve the purpose of online learning. The CNN model is distributed into two parts so that the training occurs at the cloud and prediction happens at the edge server. Moreover, the questionnaire was used to obtain the students' learning status, understand their difficulties in dance learning, and record the corresponding dance teaching videos to make up for their weak links. Finally, the edge-cloud computing platform is used to help the training model learn quickly form vast amount of collected data. Our experiments show that the cloud-edge platform helps to support new teaching forms, enhance the platform's overall application performance and intelligence level, and improve the online learning experience. The application of this paper can help dance students to achieve efficient learning.;[Zhong, Liu] Shandong Univ Arts, Jinan, Peoples R China;Shandong University of Arts;Zhong, L (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Arts, Jinan, Peoples R China.;lzhong1009@163.com;;;;;;;25;1;1;0;4;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;;2192-113X;;J CLOUD COMPUT-ADV S;J.

An empirical study of data access self-admitted technical debt;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Data-intensive systems; Database access; Technical debt; Self-admitted technical debt";"CODE SMELLS; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT";Developers sometimes choose design and implementation shortcuts due to the pressure from tight release schedules. However, shortcuts introduce technical debt that increases as the software evolves. The debt needs to be repaid as fast as possible to minimize its impact on software development and software quality. Sometimes, technical debt is admitted by developers in comments and commit messages. Such debt is known as self-admitted technical debt (SATD). In data-intensive systems, where data manipulation is a critical functionality, the presence of SATD in the data access logic could seriously harm performance and maintainability. Understanding the composition and distribution of the SATDs across software systems and their evolution could provide insights into managing technical debt efficiently. We present a large-scale empirical study on the prevalence, composition, and evolution of SATD in data-intensive systems. We analyzed 83 open-source systems relying on relational databases as well as 19 systems relying on NoSQL databases. We detected SATD in source code comments obtained from different snapshots of the subject systems. To understand the evolution dynamics of SATDs, we conducted a survival analysis. Next, we performed a manual analysis of 361 sample data-access SATDs, investigating the composition of data-access SATDs and the reasons behind their introduction and removal. We identified 15 new SATD categories, out of which 11 are specific to database access operations. We found that most of the data-access SATDs are introduced in the later stages of change history rather than at the beginning. We also observed that bug fixing and refactoring are the main reasons behind the introduction of data-access SATDs.;"[Muse, Biruk Asmare; Khomh, Foutse; Antoniol, Giuliano] Polytech Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nagy, Csaba] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Software Inst, Lugano, Switzerland; [Cleve, Anthony] Univ Namur, Namur Digital Inst, Namur, Belgium";"Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Namur";Muse, BA (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;"biruk-asmare.muse@polymtl.ca; csaba.nagy@usi.ch; anthony.cleve@unamur.be; foutse.khomh@polymtl.ca; antoniol@ieee.org";Nagy, Csaba/B-7109-2014;;"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQ); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) project INSTINCT [190113]; F.R.S.-FNRS; FWO EOS project SECO-ASSIST [30446992]";"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQ)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) project INSTINCT(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); FWO EOS project SECO-ASSIST";This workss is partly funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec (FRQ), the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) and the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (F.R.S.-FNRS) project INSTINCT (190113), and the F.R.S.-FNRS and FWO EOS project SECO-ASSIST (30446992).;;58;3;3;0;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

UML modeling is perceived to be expensive and not necessarily cost-effective. It is therefore important to collect empirical evidence concerning the conditions under which the use of UML makes a practical difference. The focus of this paper is to investigate whether and how the Level of Detail (LoD) of UML diagrams impacts on the performance of maintenance tasks in a model-centric approach. A family of experiments consisting of one controlled experiment and three replications has therefore been carried out with 81 students with different abilities and levels of experience from 3 countries (The Netherlands, Spain, and Italy). The analysis of the results of the experiments indicates that there is no strong statistical evidence as to the influence of different LoDs. The analysis suggests a slight tendency toward better results when using low LoD UML diagrams, especially if used for the modification of the source code, while a high LoD would appear to be helpful in understanding the system. The participants in our study also favored low LoD diagrams because they were perceived as easier to read. Although the participants expressed a preference for low LoD diagrams, no statistically significant conclusions can be drawn from the set of experiments. One important finding attained from this family of experiments was that the participants minimized or avoided the use of UML diagrams, regardless of their LoD. This effect was probably the result of using small software systems from well-known domains as experimental materials.;"[Fernandez-Saez, Ana M.; Genero, Marcela] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Technol & Informat Syst, ALARCOS Res Grp, Paseo Univ 4, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Caivano, Danilo] Univ Bari, Dept Informat, Via E Orabona 4, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Caivano, Danilo] Univ Bari, Spin Off Co, SER&Practices Srl, Via E Orabona 4, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Chaudron, Michel R.

In this paper, we address a collaborative learning team building problem that considers two valuable grouping criteria usually considered by teachers. One of these criteria considers the understanding levels of the students with respect of the topics of a given course, and is based on building well-balanced teams in terms of the understanding levels of their members. The other criterion considers the interest levels of the students with respect of the topics of a given course, and is based on building well-balanced teams in terms of the interest levels of their members. The problem addressed has been recognised as an NP-Hard optimization problem. To solve the problem, we propose a steadystate evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm aims to organize the students taking a given course into teams in such a way that the two grouping criteria of the problem are optimized. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on nine problem instances with different levels of complexity, and is compared with that of the only algorithm previously proposed for solving the addressed problem. The obtained results show that the steady-state evolutionary algorithm significantly outperforms the previous algorithm.;"[Yannibelli, Virginia; Armentano, Marcelo; Berdun, Franco; Amandi, Analia] ISISTAN CONICET UNCPBA, Campus Univ, Tandil, Argentina";;Yannibelli, V (corresponding author), ISISTAN CONICET UNCPBA, Campus Univ, Tandil, Argentina.;"virginia.yannibelli@isistan.unicen.edu.ar; marcelo.armentano@isistan.unicen.edu.ar; franco.berdun@isistan.unicen.edu.ar; analia.amandi@isistan.unicen.edu.ar";;Amandi, Analia/0000-0003-1866-5310;;;;;23;3;3;0;1;GRAZ UNIV TECHNOLGOY, INST INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPUTER MEDIA-IICM;GRAZ;INFFELDGASSE 16C, GRAZ, A-8010, AUSTRIA;0948-695X;;;J UNIVERS COMPUT SCI;J.

While machines are able to do the same with visual data already, less work has been done with sounds. This work develops an approach for scene understanding purely based on binaural sounds. The considered tasks include predicting the semantic masks of sound-making objects, the motion of sound-making objects, and the depth map of the scene. To this aim, we propose a novel sensor setup and record a new audio-visual dataset of street scenes with eight professional binaural microphones and a 360$\mathrm{<^>{\circ }}$& LCIRC;camera. The co-existence of visual and audio cues is leveraged for supervision transfer. In particular, we employ a cross-modal distillation framework that consists of multiple vision 'teacher' methods and a sound 'student' method - the student method is trained to generate the same results as the teacher methods do. This way, the auditory system can be trained without using human annotations. To further boost the performance, we propose another novel auxiliary task, coined Spatial Sound Super-Resolution, to increase the directional resolution of sounds. We then formulate the four tasks into one end-to-end trainable multi-tasking network aiming to boost the overall performance. Experimental results show that 1) our method achieves good results for all four tasks, 2) the four tasks are mutually beneficial - training them together achieves the best performance, 3) the number and orientation of microphones are both important, and 4) features learned from the standard spectrogram and features obtained by the classic signal processing pipeline are complementary for auditory perception tasks.

However, academic institutions have been slow to provide DevOps training in software engineering (SE) curricula. One reason for this is the fact that the problems addressed by DevOps may be hard to understand to students who have not previously worked in the industry or on projects of meaningful size and complexity. This paper shows an experience that integrates DevOps in SE curricula through research-based teaching (RBT). We aim to expose students to the problems that have led companies to adopt DevOps by researching and analyzing real cases of companies, thereby placing students at the center of learning. The contribution of this work is to innovate the application of RBT in software engineering by showing that the RBT approach is, at least, as good as the traditional approach and that it also leads to some extra benefits. This innovative solution has been implemented by using (i) qualitative analysis, specifically coding techniques, to discover knowledge and (ii) inter-coder agreement (ICA), specifically Krippendorff's alpha coefficients, to measure the extent of students' learning. These techniques allow teachers to determine whether students' learning in the subject is homogeneous and to analyze disagreements among students during their analysis. This approach provides teachers with new tools (Krippendorff's a coefficients) to identify those concepts that are less understood by students and to evaluate whether improvements in the research instruments (e.g., the codebook used in the qualitative analysis) also generate improvements in the students' agreement. This RBT experience shows evidence that can be used to assess whether a similar experience and the use of ICA could be applied in similar learning contexts with similar research contexts.;"[Perez, Jorge E.; Diaz, Jessica; Lopez-Fernandez, Daniel; Garcia-Martin, Javier; Yague, Agustin] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Sistemas Informat, Madrid 28031, Spain; [Gonzalez-Prieto, Angel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Matemat, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Gonzalez-Prieto, Angel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Inst Ciencias Matemat CSIC UAM UC3M UCM, E-28049 Madrid, Spain";"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas (ICMAT)";Díaz, J (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Sistemas Informat, Madrid 28031, Spain.;"jorgeenrique.perez@upm.es; gonzalezprieto@uam.es; yesica.diaz@upm.es; daniel.lopeze@upm.es; javier.garciam@upm.es; agustin.yague@upm.es";"Diaz, Jessica/J-9751-2012; Pérez-Martínez, Jorge Enrique/AAS-5194-2020; Yague, Agustin/M-2229-2014";"Diaz, Jessica/0000-0001-6738-9370; Pérez-Martínez, Jorge Enrique/0000-0003-3349-6017; Lopez Fernandez, Daniel/0000-0003-1265-010X; Yague, Agustin/0000-0002-4761-0901";Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through the project Research-based teaching in the DevOps domain [IE1920.6104];Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through the project Research-based teaching in the DevOps domain;This work was supported by the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid through the project Research-based teaching in the DevOps domain under Grant IE1920.6104.;;45;1;1;6;19;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;0098-5589;1939-3520;;IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG;IEEE Trans.

The study used the mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. In determining the subject of the research-namely, 251 chil-dren consisting of second graders and fifth graders in Jakarta, Indonesia-we used purposive sampling. Purposive sampling was also used to determine the research location-namely, two public primary schools and two private primary schools in Central and South Jakarta. As for the data collection, questionnaires, interviews, and observations were employed, resulting in quantitative data presented statistically in tables and charts. The regression analysis per-formed to figure out the social development of the primary school students in Jakarta resulted in a score of 0.000, suggesting that the students possess social capabilities and skills displayed when they are among their peers-namely, understanding the emotional conditions of their friends, accepting themselves, and maintaining friendship. The students are also capable of comprehending the thought, feeling, and behavior of their friends, thus enabling them to develop well-being skills. A regression analysis score of 0.001 suggests that gadget usage at home and at school influence the linguistic development of the primary school students. Our qualitative analysis corroborates the regression score by suggesting that gadget usage improves the growth and development of the social and linguistic behavior of the primary school students. In light of the impacts of gadget usage on the social and linguistic develop-ment of the primary school students, it is highly recommended that both the school and the parents put in place a code of ethics and educational guidance regarding gadget usage to mitigate the negative impacts of gadgets on students.;"[Stevanus, Ivan] Univ Katolik Indonesia Atma Jaya, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Parida, Lusila] STKIP Persada Khatulistiwa, Sintang, Indonesia";University Katolik Indonesia Atma Jaya;Stevanus, I (corresponding author), Univ Katolik Indonesia Atma Jaya, Jakarta, Indonesia.;"ivan.stevanus@atmajaya.ac.id; 30101986LP@gmail.com";;;;;;;29;0;0;2;2;INT ASSOC ONLINE ENGINEERING;WIEN;KIRCHENGASSE 10-200, WIEN, A-1070, AUSTRIA;;2626-8493;;INT J ONLINE BIOMED;Int.

Introduction: Older adults face a much higher risk of sudden illness/injury and are the age group with the largest percentages of emergent and urgent healthcare visits. Emergency information (health information needed in an emergency situation such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives) needs to be maintained and easily accessible to ensure older adults get appropriate care and treatment consistent with their wishes in emergency situations. Current health information technologies rarely take into consideration the emergency information needs of older adults, their caregivers, and emergency responders. Methods: As part of a larger study we performed in-depth interviews with 90 older adults living in a variety of residential settings (independent living, retirement communities, assisted living) regarding how they manage information about their health. Interview sessions included photos of important health information artifacts. Interviews were transcribed and coded. Results: Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that emergency information is a type of health information that older adults frequently manage. Participants differed in whether they practice emergency planning (e.g. the preparation and continued management of emergency information), and in whether they involve others in emergency information and emergency planning. Despite its importance, emergency information was often not up-to-date and not always kept in locations readily apparent to emergency responders. Conclusion: Emergency information, such as emergency contact information, diagnoses, and advance directives, is a type of health information that older adults manage. Considering emergency information in the design of health information technologies for older adults could address some of the barriers and support the facilitators to emergency planning and information management.;"[Turner, Anne M.; Osterhage, Katie; Loughran, Julie; Painter, Ian] Univ Washington, Northwest Ctr Publ Hlth Practice, 1107 NE 45th St,Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Turner, Anne M.; Osterhage, Katie; Loughran, Julie; Painter, Ian; Phelan, Elizabeth A.] Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Turner, Anne M.; Demiris, George; Hartzler, Andrea L.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat & Med Educ, 850 Republican St,Box 358047, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Demiris, George] Univ Washington, Sch Nursing, Dept Biobehav Nursing & Hlth Informat, Box 357260, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Phelan, Elizabeth A.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Harborview Med Ctr, Div Gerontol & Geriatr Med, 325 9th Ave,Box 359755, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Loughran, Julie] Planned Parenthood Great Northwest & Hawaiian Isl, 2001 East Madison, Seattle, WA 98122 USA";"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harborview Medical Center";Turner, AM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Northwest Ctr Publ Hlth Practice, 1107 NE 45th St,Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.;"amturner@uw.edu; katieost@uw.edu; Julie.Loughran@ppgnhi.org; ipainter@uw.edu; gdemiris@uw.edu; andreah@uw.edu; phelane@uw.edu";;"HARTZLER, ANDREA/0000-0003-4932-7314; Demiris, George/0000-0002-6318-5829";Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [R01HS022106];Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality);This research was supported by funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [Grant #R01HS022106].

J;"Srivani, M; Murugappan, A";;;;"Srivani, M.; Murugappan, Abirami";;;Design of a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model to Assess the Reasoning Levels of Primary School Children;EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Customized AI based teaching; Cognitive performance test; Reasoning coefficient; Cognition level; Knowledge representation; Cognitive metrics";"MATHEMATICAL THINKING; STUDENTS PERFORMANCE; TASKS";"Background and aim: In recent days, the research on student's intelligence level modelling is a challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) task, which gains more attraction because it provides actionable insights to the tutor by analysing the intelligence level of the learners. Each learner's knowledge, comprehension, and intellectual capacities are unique. It is critical to identify these capacities and provide learners, particularly slow learners, with the necessary knowledge. Cognitive Performance Test (CPT) is an essential component for assessing the knowledge level of students. The reasoning level or coefficient deals with the analysis of the thinking capability in a logical way. It also reflects the child's learning potential. The main aim of the proposed system is to design a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model (CKRM), which fuses Cognitive Performance Metrics (CPM) calculation and Reasoning Coefficient Calculation (RCC) algorithms to assess the student's intelligence level. The result of the proposed system is stratification of students to three different ranges of reasoning coefficient.Methods: The CKRM consists of the following phases: data collection, statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building and analysis, which involve the assessment of the knowledge level using CPT and calculation of reasoning coefficient using First Order Logic (FOL), and finally model evaluation using cognitive evaluation metrics. CPM and RCC algorithms have been proposed in this paper to calculate the student's reasoning coefficient by using the forward chaining FOL inference engine. The dataset is a real time data which consists of the academic and cognitive performance details of school students from classes 1 to 6 for the year 2019 to 2020. The academic data are collected from the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) maintained by the school. The cognitive performance data are collected by conducting the tests for the students using the memory training application called Lumosity.Results: The proposed system's performance is evaluated using ten Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in which the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis achieved an accuracy of 0.97 for classes 1, 2, and 3. For classes 4, 5, and 6, nearly twelve ML algorithms are evaluated in which Random Forest (RF) Classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.98. Six math expert committee teachers concluded that the reasoning coefficient value was acceptable with an average accuracy of 0.92 for classes 1, 2, 3 and 0.9 for classes 4, 5, 6. In comparison to the pre-existing models employed in the prior research, it was determined that the created CKRM (academic and cognitive) was superior. The cognitive metrics such as taskability, Response Time (RT), knowledge capacity and utilization has also been evaluated. The average values of taskability, RT, knowledge capacity and knowledge utilization are 0.85, 0.81, 0.55, and 0.44.Conclusion: The ultimate goal is to make customized teaching easier; hence, this article involves determining a student's cognitive level by estimating their reasoning coefficient. The suggested approach analyses and categorizes students' cognitive abilities, such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, thinking, and logical reasoning, using three different reasoning coefficients. This approach assists teachers in determining the degree of intelligence of their students.";"[Srivani, M.; Murugappan, Abirami] Anna Univ, Coll Engn Guindy, Dept Informat Sci & Technol, Chennai, India; [Srivani, M.] Innovat Sci Pursuit Inspired Res INSPIRE, New Delhi, India";"Anna University; Anna University Chennai; College of Engineering Guindy";Srivani, M (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Coll Engn Guindy, Dept Informat Sci & Technol, Chennai, India.;"srivaniresearch@gmail.com; abirami@auist.net";M, SRIVANI/HHZ-7936-2022;M, SRIVANI/0000-0003-3919-4167;"Government of India, Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Science and Technology, India (Delhi); Government of India, Department of Science and Technology Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi; DST for the award of DST-INSPIRE fellowship [IF180374]";"Government of India, Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Science and Technology, India (Delhi); Government of India, Department of Science and Technology Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi; DST for the award of DST-INSPIRE fellowship";The authors declare the following financial interests/personal rela- tionships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Srivani M reports financial support was provided by Government of India, Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Science and Technology, India (Delhi) .

Our joint study was inspired by his lifetime trailblazing research program rooted in causal gene regulatory networks (GRNs), system completeness, genomic Boolean logic, and genomically encoded regulatory information. We present first four inspiring questions that Eric Davidson asked, and the follow-up, namely, seven technical problems, fully or partially resolved with the methods of computer science. At the center, and unifying the intellectual backbone of those technical challenges, stands Causality.'' Our collaboration produced the causalityinferred cisGRN-Lexicon database, containing the cis-regulatory architecture (CRA) of 600+ transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes and other regulatory genes, in eight species: human, mouse, fruit fly, sea urchin, nematode, rat, chicken, and zebrafish. These CRAs are causality-inferred regulatory regions of genes, derived experimentally through the experimental method called cis-regulatory analysis'' ( also known as the Davidson criteria''). In this research program, causality challenges for computer science show up in two components: ( 1) how to define data structures that represent the causality-inferred, by the Davidson criteria, DNA structure data and to define a versatile software system to host them; and ( 2) how to identify by automated software for text analysis the experimental technical articles applying the Davidson criteria to the analysis to genes. We next present the cisGRN-Lexicon Meta-Analysis ( Part I). We conclude the article with some reflections on epistemology and philosophy themes concerning the role of causality, logic, and proof in the emerging elegant mathematical theory and practice of the regulatory genome. It is challenging to explain what explanation'' is, and to understand what understanding'' is, when the technical task is to prove'' system-level causality completeness of a 50-gene causal GRN. Within the Peter-Davidson Boolean GRN model, the Peter-Davidson completeness theorem'' provides a seminal answer: Experimental causality system completeness = Computational exact prediction completeness. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to our Prof. Eric Davidson. Section 3 gives a brief introduction for computer scientists to the regulatory genome and its information processing operations in terms similar to the electronic computer. Section 4 proposes to honor Eric Davidson's life-long scientific work on the regulatory genome by naming a most fundamental time unit constant after him. Section 5 presents four grand challenge questions that Eric Davidson asked, and seven follow-up problems inspired by the first two questions, which we fully or partially solved together. Central to the mentioned solutions is our construction of the cisGRN-Lexcion, the database of causally inferred CRA of 600+ regulatory genes in eight species. Section 6 presents Part I of the cisGRN-Lexcion Meta-Analysis, coached as rules'' of the genomic cis-regulatory code. Section 7 is devoted to reflections on epistemological and philosophical themes: causality, logic, and proof in the elegant mathematical modeling of the regulatory genome. We present here the Davidsonian Causal Systems Biology Axioms,'' which guide us toward understanding of the meaning of proving'' causality completeness, for a complex experimental system, by exact computational predictions.";[Istrail, Sorin] Brown Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Computat Mol Biol, 115 Waterman St,5th Floor,Box 1910, Providence, RI 02912 USA;Brown University;Istrail, S (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ctr Computat Mol Biol, 115 Waterman St,5th Floor,Box 1910, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;sorin_istrail@brown.edu;;;National Science Foundation [NSF 0645955, NSF 0714609, NSF 1048831];National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF));This study was supported by the National Science Foundation grants to S.I.: Grant Nos.

While significant research has been done in this domain, specifically in using machine learning to detect elevated levels of stress, the challenge of producing a machine learning model capable of generalizing well for use on new, unseen data remain. Acute stress response has both subjective, psychological and objectively measurable, biological components that can be expressed differently from person to person, further complicating the development of a generic stress measurement model. Another challenge is the lack of large, publicly available datasets labeled for stress response that can be used to develop robust machine learning models. In this paper, we first investigate the generalization ability of models built on datasets containing a small number of subjects, recorded in single study protocols. Next, we propose and evaluate methods combining these datasets into a single, large dataset to study the generalization capability of machine learning models built on larger datasets. Finally, we propose and evaluate the use of ensemble techniques by combining gradient boosting with an artificial neural network to measure predictive power on new, unseen data. In favor of reproducible research and to assist the community advance the field, we make all our experimental data and code publicly available through Github at https://github.com/xalentis/Stress. This paper's in-depth study of machine learning model generalization for stress detection provides an important foundation for the further study of stress response measurement using sensor biomarkers, recorded with wearable technologies.Methods: Sensor biomarker data from six public datasets were utilized in this study. Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the physiological variance between study subjects, and the complexity it introduces in building machine learning models capable of detecting elevated levels of stress on new, unseen data. To test model generalization, we developed a gradient boosting model trained on one dataset (SWELL), and tested its predictive power on two datasets previously used in other studies (WESAD, NEURO). Next, we merged four small datasets, i.e. (SWELL, NEURO, WESAD, UBFC-Phys), to provide a combined total of 99 subjects, and applied feature engineering to generate additional features utilizing statistical summaries, with sliding windows of 25 s. We name this large dataset, StressData. In addition, we utilized random sampling on StressData combined with another dataset (EXAM) to build a larger training dataset consisting of 200 synthesized subjects, which we name SynthesizedStressData. Finally, we developed an ensemble model that combines our gradient boosting model with an artificial neural network, and tested it using Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) validation, and on two additional, unseen publicly available stress biomarker datasets (WESAD and Toadstool).Results: Our results show that previous models built on datasets containing a small number (<50) of subjects, recorded in single study protocols, cannot generalize well to new, unseen datasets. Our presented methodology for generating a large, synthesized training dataset by utilizing random sampling to construct scenarios closely aligned with experimental conditions demonstrate significant benefits. When combined with feature-engineering and ensemble learning, our method delivers a robust stress measurement system capable of achieving 85% predictive accuracy on new, unseen validation data, achieving a 25% performance improvement over single models trained on small datasets. The resulting model can be used as both a classification or regression predictor for estimating the level of perceived stress, when applied on specific sensor biomarkers recorded using a wearable device, while further allowing researchers to construct large, varied datasets for training machine learning models that closely emulate their exact experimental conditions.Conclusion: Models trained on small, single study protocol datasets do not generalize well for use on new, unseen data and lack statistical power. Machine learning models trained on a dataset containing a larger number of varied study subjects capture physiological variance better, resulting in more robust stress detection. Feature-engineering assists in capturing these physiological variance, and this is further improved by utilizing ensemble techniques by combining the predictive power of different machine learning models, each capable of learning unique signals contained within the data. While there is a general lack of large, labeled public datasets that can be utilized for training machine learning models capable of accurately measuring levels of acute stress, random sampling techniques can successfully be applied to construct larger, varied datasets from these smaller sample datasets, for building robust machine learning models.;"[Vos, Gideon; Trinh, Kelly; Azghadi, Mostafa Rahimi] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Sarnyai, Zoltan] James Cook Univ, Coll Publ Hlth Med & Vet Sci, James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia";"James Cook University; James Cook University";Azghadi, MR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;mostafa.rahimiazghadi@jcu.edu.au;;"Sarnyai, Zoltan/0000-0002-2380-7902; Trinh, Kelly/0000-0002-1814-6847; Vos, Gideon/0000-0001-6491-5021";;;;;40;1;1;5;6;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1532-0464;1532-0480;;J BIOMED INFORM;J.

The basic units of computation are qubits, which are abstract objects with a mathematical expression to implement the quantum mechanics principles. Alongside quantum hardware, software is a principal element for conducting quantum computing. The software consists of logic gates and quantum circuits that implement algorithms for the execution of quantum programs. Due to those characteristics, quantum computing is a paradigm that non-physics experts cannot understand. Under this new scheme for developing software, it is important to integrate a conceptual framework of the fundamentals on which quantum computing is based. In this paper, we present a kind of taxonomical view of the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and the derived concepts that integrate the emerging discipline of quantum software engineering. We performed a quasi-systematic mapping for conducting the systematic review because the objective of the review only intends to detect the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and quantum software.

In a quickly evolving technology landscape, QC is emerging as a promising pathway to overcome the growth limits in classical computing. In some cases, QC platforms offer the potential to vastly outperform the familiar classical computer by solving problems more quickly or that may be intractable on any known classical platform. As further performance gains for classical computing platforms are limited by diminishing Moore's Law scaling, QC platforms might be viewed as a potential successor to the current field of exascale-class platforms. While present-day QC hardware platforms are still limited in scale, the field of quantum computing is robust and rapidly advancing in terms of hardware capabilities, software environments for developing quantum algorithms, and educational programs for training the next generation of scientists and engineers. After a brief introduction to QC concepts, the focus of this article is to explore the interplay between the fields of visualization and QC. First, visualization has played a role in QC by providing the means to show representations of the quantum state of single-qubits in superposition states and multiple-qubits in entangled states. Second, there are a number of ways in which the field of visual data exploration and analysis may potentially benefit from this disruptive new technology though there are challenges going forward.;"[Bethel, E.

J;Min, Z;;;;Min, Zhu;;;Design of interactive evaluation system for college students' psychological education based on improved KNN algorithm;SOFT COMPUTING;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Improved KNN algorithm; Psychological education; Data mining; Automatic evaluation system";MENTAL-HEALTH;Based on the research and investigation of the psycho-educational development and assessment of college students, this paper designs an interactive system for automatic evaluation of the psychoeducation of college students, which is based on the KNN data classification model and the current technical and environmental conditions. Based on the data from the psychological survey of college students and personal information, this article screens the psychological evaluation data of students, analyzes the key information in the data, obtains the correlation rules of various factors, and analyzes the experimental results. Aiming at the problem that KNN algorithm has low classification accuracy on unbalanced data, we proposes a weighted KNN hybrid algorithm. The harmonic weighted KNN classifier is added to the SVM-KNN classifier for fitting, and the SVM-KNN hybrid algorithm is jointly established. Combined with the principle of SVM-KNN hybrid data classifier, the improved algorithm is applied to a wider range of data value areas, and the appropriate algorithm is selected for data classification and prediction by judging the threshold size. For the data classification calculation method, the Euclidean distance calculation method is generally used to calculate the point-to-point distance in the plane coordinate system, as for hyper plane high-dimensional data, the improved algorithm uses a more suitable kernel function calculation method. According to the designed experimental step program, a series of basic performance such as the calculation rate of the algorithm and the system are tested, and the results show that it can be satisfied, which proves that the interactive automatic evaluation system of College Students' psychological education designed in this paper can effectively understand the psychological status of college students at this stage, find the students who need to focus on psychological counseling, and carry out psychological health education, so as to provide reference for the actual college students' psychological health education.;[Min, Zhu] Guangzhou City Polytech, Guangzhou 510405, Guangdong, Peoples R China;;Min, Z (corresponding author), Guangzhou City Polytech, Guangzhou 510405, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;zhumin223311@163.com;;;;;;;18;0;0;5;6;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;2023 JUN 27;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00500-023-08794-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-023-08794-6;;JUN 2023;10;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;L1OJ7;;Green Submitted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001021016800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study explores the online engagement behaviours of high-performing online students. Three years of data derived from students' online activities and academic performance across six computing courses was analysed. Our findings reveal a continuity of high-performance among students who excel in online introductory programming courses, extending their success to subsequent online computing courses. Furthermore, we establish a positive association between programming experience and improved performance. High-performing students exhibit engagement levels that exceed their peers by at least 100% in online formative learning activities, with particular emphasis on forum participation and quiz contribution. This study also looked into the predictive potential of past academic performances in anticipating future achievements. It demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 75% for programming courses and 91% for non-programming ones. When combined with student engagement data, the predictive accuracy for programming courses increases to 81%. This approach requires substantial data until at least week 7 or 8 of a 10-week course, potentially delaying intervention until the latter stage of the course. To address this, exploring models exclusively reliant on engagement data is recommended. Our research offers actionable insights for educators, enabling them to identify critical content design elements that enhance academic performance across diverse student profiles, fostering improved online engagement and narrowing performance gaps. Moreover, this study calls for a re-evaluation of learning analytics tools within educational institutions to better understand and enhance student behaviours and patters, ultimately improving the overall online learning experience.;"[Abadia, Rhodora; Liu, Sisi; Sun, Qiaoling] Univ South Australia, Adelaide, Australia";University of South Australia;Abadia, R (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.;;;;;;;;39;0;0;3;3;IADIS;LISBOA;IADIS, LISBOA, 00000, PORTUGAL;1646-3692;;;IADIS-INT J COMPUT S;IADIS-Int.

Delayed completion of these courses is a common issue that affects both students and higher education institutions. This study employed clustering analysis to create clusters of thesis topics. The research model was constructed using expert labeling to assign each thesis title to a computer science ontology standard. Cross-referencing was employed to associate supporting courses with each thesis title, resulting in a labeled dataset with three supporting courses for each thesis title. This study analyzed five different clustering algorithms, including K-Means, DBScan, BIRCH, Gaussian Mixture, and Mean Shift, to identify the best approach for analyzing undergraduate thesis data. The results demonstrated that k-means clustering is the most efficient method, generating five distinct clusters with unique characteristics. Furthermore, this study investigated the correlation between educational data, specifically GPA, and the average grades of courses that support a thesis title and the duration of thesis completion. Our investigation revealed a moderate correlation between GPA, thesis-supporting course average grades, and the time to complete the thesis, with higher academic performance being associated with shorter completion times. These moderate results indicate the need for further studies to explore additional factors beyond GPA and the average grades of thesis-supporting courses that contribute to delays in thesis completion. This study contributes to the understanding and evaluation of educational outcomes within study programs, as defined in the curriculum, particularly concerning the design and implementation of thesis topics. Additionally, the clustering results serve as a foundation for future research and offer valuable insights into the potential of EDM techniques to assist in selecting appropriate thesis topics, thereby reducing the risk of delayed completion.;"[Suciati, Nanik; Fabroyir, Hadziq] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Fac Intelligent Elect & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Surabaya 60111, Indonesia; Univ Surabaya, Fac Engn, Dept Informat, Surabaya 60293, Indonesia; [Pardede, Eric] La Trobe Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia";"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember; Universitas Surabaya (UBAYA); La Trobe University";Suciati, N (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Fac Intelligent Elect & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Surabaya 60111, Indonesia.;nanik@if.its.ac.id;;"Pardede, Eric/0000-0001-8218-2343; Fabroyir, Hadziq/0000-0002-2529-1962; Suciati, Nanik/0000-0002-1991-0464";Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, Indonesia;Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, Indonesia;No Statement Available;;40;0;0;2;4;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;130072;130088;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3332818;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3332818;;;17;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";AU5I9;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001120976800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional teaching methods need to make full use of information technology. They cannot meet the current learning needs because the learning of information technology teaching is an essential means to realize modern learning. , therefore, the application of information technology in music education meets the requirements of the times.OBJECTIVES: To improve traditional teaching methods by utilizing modern teaching techniques so that students can gain more knowledge. With the help of modern technology and information technology, secondary music education can change the students' audiovisual experience, enrich their musical experience, and deepen their understanding and memorization of knowledge.METHODS: In this paper, use a neural network algorithm to explore the integration mechanism of music teaching design and education information technology, optimize the traditional information technology teaching platform, improve the stability of the music teaching platform, and further improve the level of network teaching from the feedback of students and teachers.RESULTS: This study's results found that this experiment's educational platform could motivate students to manage teaching and actively participate in music teaching and lessons. However, due to the real-time nature of information technology, it removes doubts between the parties and facilitates communication between teachers and students. The primary goal of music education is to perceive the attraction of music in terms of sight and sound, to relax the mind and body, and to develop a musical personality. From this perspective, it is also necessary to utilize modern information technology to change teachers' traditional teaching methods in classical performance and singing.CONCLUSION: With the help of modern technology and information technology, secondary music education can change the audiovisual experience of students, enrich their musical experience, and deepen their understanding and memorization of knowledge.

The paper presents a concept of upgrading the laboratory practice curriculum in power electronics by introducing computer simulations. Due to the recognized shortcomings of the previous approach, the curriculum was closely reviewed, compared to the concepts from existing literature, and intensively upgraded by the introduction of the Ansys Simplorer computer program. The intensity of the process upgrade was enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. The introduced curriculum changes enabled the students to approach individual topics more gradually, reducing the gaps between the behavior of ideal and real power electronics circuits. The results of student feedback, obtained by a web-based survey and a pre-exam quiz, demonstrate that students recognize the new approach as being more gradual and beneficial, enabling them to improve their understanding of specific phenomena and to master the topics of power electronics with ease and satisfaction.;"[Rihar, Andraz; Voncina, Danjel; Zajec, Peter] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Mechatron, Lab Control Engn & Power Elect, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Rihar, Andraz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Mechatron, Lab Control Engn & Power Elect, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia";"University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana";Rihar, A (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Mechatron, Lab Control Engn & Power Elect, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.;andraz.rihar@fe.uni-lj.si;;;"Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science, and Sport; Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0258]";"Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science, and Sport; Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia)";The authors would like to thank the survey participants, students of classes 2019 to 2021, for their excellent response rates and fruitful comments that will surely help us additionally improve the laboratory practices and the corresponding teaching approaches in the near future.

Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, inte-grating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients.";"[Ossa, Laura Arbelaez; Rost, Michael; Lorenzini, Giorgia; Shaw, David M.; Elger, Bernice Simone] Univ Basel, Inst Biomed Ethics, Basel, Switzerland; [Shaw, David M.] Maastricht Univ, Care & Publ Hlth Res Inst, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Elger, Bernice Simone] Univ Geneva, Ctr Legal Med CURML, Geneva, Switzerland";"University of Basel; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); University of Geneva";Ossa, LA (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Biomed Ethics, Basel, Switzerland.;laura.arbelaezossa@unibas.ch;"; Elger, Bernice Simone/V-7265-2017";"Rost, Michael/0000-0001-6537-9793; Arbelaez Ossa, Laura/0000-0002-8303-8789; Elger, Bernice Simone/0000-0002-4249-7399";"Swiss National Research foundation; [187263]; [407740_187263/1]";"Swiss National Research foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ;";This work was enabled by the Swiss National Research foundation in the framework of the National Research Program Digital Transformation , NRP 77 [project number 187263, Grant No:407740_187263/1,recipient: Prof. Bernice Simone Elger] .;;44;4;4;7;26;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0933-3657;1873-2860;;ARTIF INTELL MED;Artif.

When assessing the teaching effectiveness of project-driven immersion teaching in extreme programming, the primary issue involves great uncertainty. Neutrosophic linguistic set, portrayed by three membership degrees to linguistic variable, is an effective tool to seize uncertainty. In this paper, the objective weight is calculated by CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation) method while the integrated weight is determined by synchronously reflecting subjective information and objective information. Then, neutrosophic linguistic MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) algorithm based CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) is presented for solving counterintuitive phenomenon.

It is a worldwide traditional sports activity. In the history of human-horse racing, horse racing activities in various eras have been followed but also constantly innovated. According to the K-means clustering algorithm, a cluster analysis model is constructed for the model, and the algorithm model is applied to the students' mental health counseling work. After six iterations to get the classification and six iterations of the cluster center algorithm, it was found that the mixed psychological population accounted for 50%. Horse racing can not only effectively relieve students' psychological problems and exercise students' willpower and thinking ability, but also promote traditional sports. Through K-means clustering algorithm research, frame design, and program design, a complete psychological disorder intervention system is established, which provides scientific, objective, and reliable data guarantee for the correct implementation of decision-making strategies. Integrating cluster analysis into the process of students' mental health analysis makes it easier for decision-makers to understand and master all aspects of students' information, to analyze and customize solutions for different types of students.

Based on the basic theories and methods of big data distributed data mining and machine learning, automated machine learning, and big data programming computational methods, this paper combines the importance and technical challenges of the algorithms themselves and the background of the practical application needs of the industry and firstly selects a series of data mining and machine learning algorithms that are commonly used based on high complexity, outstanding computational efficiency problems, and difficult to design distributed algorithms. The research on efficient large-scale distributed parallelized data mining and machine learning methods and algorithms is carried out. As an innovative teaching model, the experiential teaching model focuses on the cultivation of individual students' independent learning ability and subjective initiative, which not only can effectively activate the classroom atmosphere and improve the teaching effect but also meet the requirements of classroom teaching for the development of the times. The empirical evidence of the experiential teaching model proposed in this paper is carried out, and the implementation process of the experiential teaching model of high school physics is further improved. In terms of the overall implementation effect, the experiential teaching model proposed in the paper can deepen students' understanding of concepts and physical laws, thus enabling them to solve physics problems better, and has a positive and active effect on enhancing students' learning interests and attitudes.

J;Wu, HB;;;;Wu, Haobang;;;RETRACTED: Real Time Facial Expression Recognition for Online Lecture (Retracted Article);WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING;;;English;"Article; Retracted Publication";;;;;;;;In order to better improve online teaching during the epidemic, teachers can adjust the teaching according to the students' understanding. During the epidemic period, online teaching has become a basic way for teachers to teach. One big problem with online teaching is that the lecturers find it hard to see the students' facial expressions. According to the study, the students' facial expressions are essential for the instructor to understand the students' understanding of the course material. There are some relevant studies on the recognition of human facial expressions. However, most of them did not consider some expressions such as Enlightened, Confused, or Bored. This study helps teachers to improve the quality of teaching by designing a program to provide them with students' facial expressions. The study, implemented on students' computers, can capture their faces from a camera, identify some common and useful facial expressions, and send them to lecturers regularly during online lectures. The main research methods used in this paper are as follows: (1) Use the face recognition algorithm provided by OpenCV to capture faces. (2) Train a convolutional neural network model to recognize the expression Happy, Surprised, Neutral, Enlightened, Confusion, and Boredom. (3) Use the message protocol EMQX to transmit the expression information. This study can successfully capture faces, and about 80% accuracy can identify expressions and successfully transmit expression information. This study contains some expressions rarely studied by others and is innovative in the field of facial expression recognition.

The teaching plan introduces courses with Chinese elements such as the history of Chinese philosophy and the introduction of Chinese literary classics. Through the courses of Chinese literature and culture, students are guided to ask questions, apply theory to practice, conduct experiments, obtain data, and then analyze problems and draw conclusions according to certain research methods, which exercises students' thinking ability. This also improves students' language application ability through English writing courses. In addition, this paper designs an English language and literature teaching system. With the support and guidance of the English intelligent teaching system, it analyzes the learning level and weaknesses and puts forward teaching suggestions. Then, data mining technology is used to find the key information in the answers from the massive data and is applied to English teaching. In the English learning test, the average attitude of the experimental class was 1.3314 points. This research will effectively solve the problem of English major courses.;"[Chen, Meiyi; Yuan, Zaicheng] Hubei Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Foreign Languages, Xiangyang 441053, Hubei, Peoples R China";Hubei University of Arts & Science;Yuan, ZC (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Foreign Languages, Xiangyang 441053, Hubei, Peoples R China.;"yp50090802417@163.com; frankyzc@hbuas.edu.cn";;;;;;;23;1;1;4;36;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

Current nursing students living in a hyperconnected world are expected to expand telenursing and foster changes in nursing. Therefore, it is important to understand nursing students' perceptions about telenursing to prepare innovatively for this changing field. This study explored nursing students' subjective perceptions about telenursing in South Korea using Q-methodology. Forty Q-statements, which reflected the nursing metaparadigm, were extracted from 175 generated statements; then, 40 nursing students-recruited purposively through snowball sampling-ranked the set of Q-statements. The data were analyzed using the PQMethod program. Five perceptions concerning telenursing were identified: concerns and suggestions for telenursing, complete support for telenursing, inevitable acceptance of telenursing, distrust and criticism regarding telenursing, and optional acceptance of telenursing.

This study focuses on the visual programming environment and critical thinking as the gateway skill for student success in understanding programming. Twenty-five critical thinking criteria were synthesized from the literature. As a quantitative study, 217 randomly selected students from an approximate target population of 500 programming students to rate four learning Apps, namely, Scratch, Alice, Blockly and MIT App Inventor, against critical thinking criteria to establish the App that best promotes critical thinking among first year programming students. There were 175 responses received from the 217 randomly chosen programming students who willingly contributed to the study. Consequently, the distinctiveness of this paper lies in its use of the Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) multi-criteria decision-making algorithm to rank criteria for critical thinking, calculate their weights on the basis of informed opinion and hence scientifically deduce the best rated App among the available alternatives that promote critical thinking among first year programming students. The results showed that Scratch promoted critical thinking skills the best in first year programming students whilst Blockly promoted critical thinking skills the least. As a contribution to the study, policy-makers and academic staff can be potentially supported to make informed decisions about the types of learning Apps to consider for students when confronted with multiple selection criteria.;"[Singh, Kesarie] Durban Univ Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Durban, South Africa; [Naicker, Nalindren; Rajkoomar, Mogiveny] Durban Univ Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Durban, South Africa";"Durban University of Technology; Durban University of Technology";Singh, K (corresponding author), Durban Univ Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Durban, South Africa.;;Naicker, Nalindren/KEH-6243-2024;Naicker, Nalindren/0000-0001-7351-9717;;;;;45;3;3;2;9;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.;"[Castro, Laura M.

Access to higher education remains a challenge for many families. The emergence of Industry 4.0 will not only affect technological changes but also people in the labour market. As such, higher education institutions with academic responsibilities of formally training students to better adapt to such changes are not left out. Since the introduction of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States of America in 1908 and over one hundred years of history, this prestigious programme has suffered a rapid decline in enrolments worldwide. Thus, it has gradually lost its value under the current industrial revolution. This paper evaluates and prioritizes barriers affecting the decline in international MBA enrolments. Understanding the key barriers to MBA enrolments regarding the dynamics will contribute to the successful implementation of those barriers. With scarce information, this study innovatively applies the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method to prioritizing the identified barriers. When applied, this method provided a robust prediction of results. For international MBA enrolments decline, the barrier employment difficulties (H3) should receive much attention from policymakers because it scored the highest among the barriers ranked. Further, other important barriers that should be considered are lack of entrepreneurship skills (H11), high cost (H10), longer payback duration (H1), 10 yr. ROI (H9), and lack of data analytic skills (H7). Therefore, during the formulation and implementation of policy to address these prioritized barriers, scarce resources must be committed to them.

The CT elements in this research focus on four major programming concepts, which are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We have conducted game activities through several algorithms that include sorting, swapping, and graph algorithms and analyzed how the game affects the student experience (SX) in understanding the CT concept in those algorithms. We have applied the quadrilateral method approach to the data collection and analysis. The data was obtained through observation, interview/survey based on six SX criteria (attention, engagement, awareness, satisfaction, confidence, and performance), and performances of the conducted game activities were compared. The results of the quadrilation of the data collected show a positive impact on the SX, highlight the effectiveness of the competitive, physical, and tactile game approach proposed in this research towards programming and CT skills development.;"[Habib, Mohammad Ahsan; Raja-yusof, Raja-Jamilah; Salim, Siti Salwah; Sani, Asmiza Abdul; Sofian, Hazrina] Univ Malaya, Dept Software Engn, Fac Comp Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Abu Bakar, Aishah] Univ Malaysia Pahang, Fac Civil Engn Technol, Gambang, Malaysia";"Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah (UMPSA)";Raja-yusof, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Dept Software Engn, Fac Comp Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;rjry@um.edu.my;"Sofian, Hazrina/AAN-6865-2020; Sofian, Hazrina/AAH-4485-2021; Yusof, Raja Jamilah Raja/B-9545-2010; SALIM, SITI SALWAH/B-7848-2010";"Sofian, Hazrina/0000-0001-8375-6441; Sofian, Hazrina/0000-0001-8375-6441;";"University of Malaya [RU002Y-2016, IF024-2018]; European Commission under the Erasmus plus [586297-EPP-1-2017-1-EL-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]";"University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya); European Commission under the Erasmus plus";We would like to thank the University of Malaya for providing the UM-LiTeR grant (RU002Y-2016) .

Upon defining an automaton, it is possible to run a visual simulation of the automaton operation for an arbitrary input string, whereby a textual description of the automaton simulation is also obtained. Furthermore, the system allows for conversion of regular expressions to deterministic finite automata and nondeterministic finite automata. The simulation of Thompson's construction algorithm is implemented, so that transformation of a regular expression to the corresponding NFA can be monitored in a step-by-step process.

Typically, these digital control concepts and algorithms are implemented in high-resources microcontrollers; nevertheless, we show that they can also be implemented in low-resource devices, helping students to acquire fundamental knowledge and develop long-term skills to solve real problems from the learning they achieve in their undergraduate educational programs in control or computer engineering. For this purpose, we provide an algorithm to synthesize a digital proportional-derivative controller oriented to low-resource microcontrollers (microcontrollers without floating-point unit). This algorithm allows implementing solutions for classic controllers in low-resource microcontrollers applied to academic and technological fields. This algorithm reduces the excessive amount of execution time in a low-resource microcontroller, it works with integer numbers and it is designed to implement fast classical controllers, which typically are performed with floating-point operations. Furthermore, we present a brief description of the implemented electronic circuit, serving as a guide for students to develop their own circuits. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can be successfully applied to an electromagnetic levitation system, which is commonly used in the academic training of electronics and control engineers, mainly due to its unstable nature.

Depending on which part is needed to recover, the denser product or the pure liquid, we use the term thickening or clarification to define these operations. Thickener design is compulsory for chemical engineering (CE) curricula and is usually introduced in courses related to unit operations. Thickening design problems are solved by geometric methods (e.g., Coe-Clevenger or Kynch-Roberts methods). However, nowadays, computers play a more and more important role in CE practice. Both specific and general software solutions are essential. Whereas CE-specific software is adequate for graduates and professionals, general mathematical software can also be used in class. They can help to deliver certain competences included in the vast majority of CE curricula. For CE introductory courses, software with integrated functions and friendly interfaces are generally preferred over those that require to be familiarized with programming languages. Here, we describe the use of SMath Studio in 2nd-year engineering courses by nonfamiliarized students. SMath Studio is a comprehensive mathematical notebook, similar to Mathcad, but it is entirely free for personal or commercial use. In this study, student's opinion was surveyed. Around 70 students took part in the two-phase survey. The use of SMath allowed students to better understand the theoretical basis, fostered critical thinking, and increased their motivation to apply this software for solving other engineering problems.;"[Gallardo-Rodriguez, Juan J.; Navarro-Lopez, Elvira; del Carmen Ceron-Garcia, Maria; Beas-Catena, Alba; Sanchez-Miron, Asterio; Garcia-Camacho, Francisco] Univ Almeria, Higher Engn Sch, Dept Chem Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Gallardo-Rodriguez, Juan J.; Beas-Catena, Alba] Univ Concepcion, Fac Engn, Dept Chem Engn, Concepcion, Chile; [Ruiz-Ortega, Ana; Beas-Catena, Alba] Andres Bello Univ, Fac Educ & Social Sci, Dept Humanities, Concepcion, Chile";"Universidad de Almeria; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad Andres Bello";Gallardo-Rodríguez, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Almeria, Higher Engn Sch, Dept Chem Engn, Almeria 04120, Spain.;jgr285@ual.es;GARCIA-CAMACHO, FRANCISCO/L-7793-2014;"GARCIA-CAMACHO, FRANCISCO/0000-0001-6168-3632; Ruiz-Ortega, Ana M./0000-0003-0597-6283; Gallardo Rodriguez, Juan Jose/0000-0003-2953-7699; Navarro Lopez, Elvira/0000-0001-9188-2966; Sanchez Miron, Asterio/0000-0001-5119-8035";University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project) [17-003];University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project);University of Concepcion (Innovative Teaching Project)., Grant/Award Number: 17-003;;15;1;1;0;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Correspondingly, the significance of producing competent computer science and information technology (IT) graduates becomes highly imperative. Already, in most developed and developing countries, there has been an increasing demand for these competencies such as network engineers, programmers, and other IT-related specialists. Although these competencies are equally valuable, programming skills constitute the core of the strength of every other IT-related competence. Nevertheless, programming is reported in the literature to be one of the most difficult courses to students. Moreover, the level of performance in programming is said to be significantly low with an attendant high rate of students' dropout. There is a concerted research effort toward addressing the challenge of poor academic performance by attempting to answer the question of what factors affect academic performance in general. However, there is scanty literature on the factors that affect the ability to understand the concept of programming in specific. This paper, therefore, reports a case study investigation of students' perception of the effect of cognitive factors as the determinant of success in computer programming. The findings showed that performance in introductory programming is impacted by a range of interrelated cognitive factors including self-efficacy and the love for technology.;"[Msane, Jotham; Murimo, Bethel Mutanga; Chani, Tarirai] Mangosuthu Univ Technol, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Umlazi, South Africa";Mangosuthu University of Technology;Msane, J (corresponding author), Mangosuthu Univ Technol, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Umlazi, South Africa.;;;;;;;;35;4;4;0;0;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

It occurs when nucleotides of two disjoint single-stranded fragments of the same chain, separated by a helical fragment, interact with each other and form base pairs. Pseudoknots are characterized by great topological diversity, and their systematic description is still a challenge. In our previous work, we have introduced the pseudoknot order a new coefficient representing the topological complexity of the pseudoknotted RNA structure. It is defined as the minimum number of base pair set decompositions, aimed to obtain the unknotted RNA structure. We have suggested how it can be useful in the interpretation and understanding of a hierarchy of RNA folding. However, it is not trivial to unambiguously identify pseudoknots and determine their orders in an RNA structure. Therefore, since the introduction of this coefficient, we have worked on the method to reliably assign pseudoknot orders in correspondence to the mechanisms that control the biological process leading to their formation in the molecule. Here, we introduce a novel graph coloring-based model for the problem of pseudoknot order assignment. We show a specialized heuristic operating on the proposed model and an alternative integer programming algorithm. The performance of both approaches is compared with that of state-of-the-art algorithms which so far have been most efficient in solving the problem in question. We summarize the results of computational experiments that evaluate our new methods in terms of classification quality on a representative data set originating from the non-redundant RNA 3D structure repository.;"[Zok, Tomasz; Badura, Jan; Swat, Sylwester; Antczak, Maciej] Poznan Univ Tech, Inst Comp Sci, Piotrowo 2, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland; [Zok, Tomasz; Figurski, Kacper] Poznan Supercomp & Networking Ctr, Jana Pawla II 10, PL-61131 Poznan, Poland; [Popenda, Mariusz; Antczak, Maciej] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Bioorgan Chem, Noskowskiego 12-14, PL-61704 Poznan, Poland";"Poznan University of Technology; Polish Academy of Sciences; Poznan Supercomputing & Networking Center; Polish Academy of Sciences";"Antczak, M (corresponding author), Poznan Univ Tech, Inst Comp Sci, Piotrowo 2, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland.;Antczak, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Bioorgan Chem, Noskowskiego 12-14, PL-61704 Poznan, Poland.";"tzok@cs.put.poznan.pl; jbadura@cs.put.poznan.pl; sswat@cs.put.poznan.pl; kfigurski@man.poznan.pl; marpop@ibch.poznan.pl; mantczak@cs.put.poznan.pl";"Zok, Tomasz/M-1714-2014; Antczak, Maciej/F-8152-2014";"Zok, Tomasz/0000-0003-4103-9238; Badura, Jan/0000-0002-3222-9542; Popenda, Mariusz/0000-0001-9965-0430; Swat, Sylwester/0000-0001-8763-0045; Antczak, Maciej/0000-0002-5320-2023";"National Science Centre, Poland [2016/23/B/ST6/03931]; Poznan University of Technology [0311/SBAD/0684]";"National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Poznan University of Technology";This research was carried out in the European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Poznan University of Technology (Poland).

Based on the statistics, this education system have millions of students attending hundreds of courses in different offered programs. Since, MOOC started, it has been facing a challenging concerns, which is also a major difference between the traditional teaching and MOOC, known as student dropout ratio. With this fact, the overall performance of MOOC is negatively impacted the real purpose of distance learning. Whereas the difference between course registration and course completion ratio in MOOC is quite large. On the better side, the emerging technologies has created several opportunities for the students to get education online, but due to multiple factors the dropout ratio of online students is high as compare to traditional school learning process. This research is focusing on the issue to understand and predict the MOOC dropout ratio. The multiple models and evaluation metrics generating variety of results as extracted from literature review. To tackle this problem, the experiment conducted in this study using KDD MOOC dataset by implementing hybrid approach of machine learning algorithms. The results suggested the appropriate improvements in the dropout accuracy ratio. Based on the fmal results, the maximum accuracy recorded as 90% that measured through random forest model. Finally, the model can help and assist the online education system to understand the early dropout prediction and to do necessary arrangements.;[Alsolami, Fawaz J.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Comp Sci Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia;King Abdulaziz University;Alsolami, FJ (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Comp Sci Dept, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.;falsolami1@kau.edu.sa;;;;;;;48;1;1;4;16;INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS;SEOUL;DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA;1738-7906;;;INT J COMPUT SCI NET;Int.

The construction of user portraits is a prerequisite for understanding user knowledge needs and developing accurate knowledge services. Academic WeChat user portraits can analyze and express changes in user needs and preference habits, and solve the problem of asymmetry between users' precise knowledge needs and academic WeChat extensive knowledge services. In view of this, this article conducts research on the issue of academic WeChat user portraits. Data collection was first carried out using questionnaires. Second, perform statistical analysis on the characteristics of the samples and extract classification labels. Finally, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to divide WeChat users into three types: initial introduction participation users, resource acquisition users, and mature users. The experimental results show that the main groups of academic WeChat users are young students, teachers and researchers. The frequency of access to WeChat public accounts by resource acquisition users and mature users is significantly higher than that of initial participation users. Participating users and mature users were introduced in the early stage to pay more attention to the dynamics and freshness of the frontiers of the subject, while resource-acquiring users paid more attention to the subject's basic knowledge and thesis writing methods.;"[Cheng, Zixuan; Zhang, Xiangxian] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zixuan] Changchun Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China";"Jilin University; Changchun University";"Cheng, ZX (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China.;Cheng, ZX (corresponding author), Changchun Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China.";zixuan_cheng@163.com;cheng, zx/HTP-6284-2023;;Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China Research on Academic New Media Knowledge Aggregation and Innovation Services Driven by Big Data [18BTQ085];Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China Research on Academic New Media Knowledge Aggregation and Innovation Services Driven by Big Data;This work was supported by Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of China Research on Academic New Media Knowledge Aggregation and Innovation Services Driven by Big Data under Grant 18BTQ085.;;32;3;3;11;111;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1868-5137;1868-5145;;J AMB INTEL HUM COMP;J.

New hardware platforms, with multiple cores and the execution of concurrent threads, require it. Despite the above, the teaching of parallelism with the usual methods and classical algorithms, make this topic hard for our students to understand. On the other hand, teaching complex topics through the techniques of gamification has already demonstrated, in a reliable way, a positive reinforcement of the student in front of the learning of complex concepts. In this work we demonstrate a way to convey the teaching of parallelism to undergraduate students using gamification in microworlds. The results obtained by the students who followed this model, compared to a control group that followed the standard model, show a statistically significant advantage in favor of the teaching of parallelism, using a gamification with microworlds model.;"[Hardasmal, Antonio J.

However, since that tool does not address technical details, some students may not know how to implement the data structures. This paper integrates the AV tool with Program Visualisation (PV) tool to help the students understanding the data structures' implementation. The integration (which is implemented as a tool named DS-PITON) works similarly as a PV tool except that the data structures are visualised with the AV tool. Through quasi experiments, it can be stated that DS-PITON helps students to get better assessment score and to complete their assessment faster (even though the impact on completion time can work in reverse on slow-paced students). Further, according to a questionnaire survey, the students believe that DS-PITON helps them learning data structure materials.

Needless to say, the PEOs-SOs mapping is very critical for program success and, therefore, a deep understanding of PEOs, SOs, and their intra/inter-correlations is very important for effective program's decisions making. In this context, this paper proposes a data mining-based approach to discover hidden knowledge of PEOs, SOs, and their mapping and correlations in engineering programs. More specifically, the proposed approach employs association rule mining techniques to generate association rules, among and between PEOs and SOs, from PEOs-SOs mapping data of a set of engineering programs, which can be then filtered and manipulated to discover the desired knowledge. To this end, a set of 152 self-study reports of engineering programs, accredited by American Board for Engineering and Technology-Engineering Accreditation Commission (ABET-EAC), are collected and the mapping data between their PEOs and ABET-EAC SOs are extracted. The dataset is processed and transformed into a representation suitable for association rules mining. This involves developing a set of PEOs labels, annotating data with PEOs labels, and extracting three target datasets. Apriori algorithm is then applied to each dataset to generate three sets of association rules. The generated association rules are then filtered and manipulated to discover the knowledge of PEOs, ABET-EAC SOs, and their mapping and correlations. Finally, a discussion on the informativeness of the discovered knowledge for the decisions making in engineering education is given.;"[Yahya, Anwar Ali; Osman, Addin] Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Comp Sci Dept, POB 1988, Najran 61441, Saudi Arabia; [Yahya, Anwar Ali; Osman, Addin] Thamar Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Comp Sci Dept, Thamar, Yemen";Najran University;Yahya, AA (corresponding author), Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Comp Sci Dept, POB 1988, Najran 61441, Saudi Arabia.;aaesmail@nu.edu.sa;Yahya, Anwar Ali/J-2451-2019;Yahya, Anwar Ali/0000-0001-5211-1878;Deanship of Scientific Research, Najran University [NU/ESCI/16/022];Deanship of Scientific Research, Najran University;Deanship of Scientific Research, Najran University, Grant/Award Number: NU/ESCI/16/022;;40;10;10;0;20;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

The educational process is frequently supported by formal lecture approaches assisted by object lessons or lab activities, and project-based learning methodologies where students engage complex questions, challenges, and problems over a longer period of time. These educational approaches are not effective when applying to learners in robotics study programs or without a programming background where time and motivation are different. To address this concern, this paper presents an educational tool developed to teach the basic principles of machine vision and image processing through the design of short case studies. As the main contribution, the proposed tool allows to shorten the training time required by students-mainly beginners-without the skills in programming and deep understanding of math hidden behind each image operation. This lets to fit theoretical and practical works into short development times. To this end, we conducted an educational experience in robotics subjects with third year students of the computer science and industrial engineering degrees.

This platform has been developed to allow users to learn, evaluate, teach and see the performance of parallel algorithms from a system's viewpoint. The Let's HPC platform's motivation comes from the experiences of teaching HPC/PDC courses and it is designed to help streamline the process of analyzing parallel programs. At the heart of this platform is a database archiving the performance and execution environment related data of standard parallel algorithm implementations run on different computing architectures using different programming environments. The online plotting and analysis tools of our platform can be combined seamlessly with the database to aid self-learning, teaching, evaluation and discussion of different HPC related topics, with a particular focus on a holistic system's perspective. The user can quantitatively compare and understand the importance of numerous deterministic as well as non deterministic factors of both the software and the hardware that impact the performance of parallel programs. Instructors of HPC/PDC related courses can use the platform's tools to illustrate the importance of proper data collection and analysis in understanding factors impacting performance as well as to encourage peer learning among students. Scripts are provided for automatically collecting performance related data, which can then be analyzed using the platform's tools. The platform also allows students to prepare a standard lab/project report aiding the instructor in uniform evaluation. The platform's modular design enables easy inclusion of performance related data from contributors as well as addition of new features in the future. This paper summarizes the background and motivation behind the Let's HPC project, the design philosophy of the platform, the present capabilities of the platform, as well as the plans for future developments.

The aim of this research is to develop a testing mechanism to measure the extent to which international students have built up digital capital. We use the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) as a framework for this investigation, built around social influence (behavioural intention) performance and effort expectancy (attitude), and facilitating conditions (ease and usefulness), using a critical theoretical approach. We further attempt to understand whether motivation for engagement with blended learning comes from intrinsic or extrinsic sources. For this study, 95 Project Management students were introduced to a blended learning approach using Blackboard, a Learning Management System. Following an introductory session, data on attitude, social influence and facilitating conditions was gathered. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to assess the influence of each variable in determining first behavioural intentions and latter attitude towards blended learning. This study contributes to the body of knowledge through identifying that social influence has a strong impact on both performance and effort expectation as well as behavioural intentions. This suggests that, overall, the social environments from which the cohort originated provided sufficient economic, social and cultural capital to also develop some digital capital.;"[Prasad, P. W.

It involves identifying and understanding a problem, articulating an algorithm or set of algorithms in the form of a solution to the problem, implementing that solution in such a way that the solution solves the problem, and evaluating the solution based on some set of criteria. CAT is an important scaffolded on-ramp as students develop more advanced computational thinking capabilities and apply computational thinking to solve problems that are more constrained and require greater expertise. Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking (SCAT) is both a longitudinal between-subjects research project and a free enrichment program supporting and guiding African-American middle school girls over three years as they iteratively design a set of complex games for social change. This article explores Scholars' reflections about the difficulties they faced while using CAT capabilities as they engaged in collaborative game design for social change over those three years. We particularly focus on how these difficulties changed over the course of three years as well as new difficulties that emerged from year to year as Scholars become more expert game designers and computational algorithmic thinkers.;"[Thomas, Jakita O.; Sun, Li] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Rankin, Yolanda] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL USA; [Minor, Rachelle] Spelman Coll, Atlanta, GA 30314 USA";"Auburn University System; Auburn University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Spelman College";Thomas, JO (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.;"jnt0020@auburn.edu; yrankin@spelman.edu; rminor@scmail.spelman.edu; lzs0070@tigermail.auburn.edu";;;National Science Foundation [DRK-12 1150098];National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF));We are grateful for the generous support of the National Science Foundation (DRK-12 1150098).;;54;15;18;2;96;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0925-9724;1573-7551;;COMPUT SUPP COOP W J;Comput.

Previous research unveils students' deficits in understanding the behavior of structural elements in a three-dimensional (3D) context due to the shortcomings of traditional lecturing approaches, which put too much emphasis on the analysis of individual structural members, thereby falling short in providing a solid, easy-to-follow, and holistic approach to analyzing complex structures with a large number of interconnected elements. In this paper, the authors introduce a new pedagogy for teaching structural analysis that incorporates mobile augmented reality (AR) and interactive 3D visualization technology. The goal of this study is to enhance the contents used in structural analysis textbooks and on worksheets by visualizing discrete structural members employing AR along with interactive 3D models in order to illustrate how the structures behave under different loading conditions. Students can interactively change the load and observe the reaction resulting from this change with the instant feedback provided by the AR interface. The feasibility of AR concepts and interaction metaphors, as well as the potential of using AR for teaching structural analysis are investigated, specifically by focusing on challenges regarding content integration and interaction. An AR application is designed and developed, and a pilot study is conducted in a junior level structural analysis class to assess the pedagogical impact and the design concepts employed by the AR tool. Control and test groups are deployed, and students' performance is measured using pre- and post-tests. The results of the pilot study indicate that the utilized AR design concepts have potential to contribute to students' learning by providing interactive and 3D visualization features, which support constructive engagement and retention of information in students.;"[Turkan, Yelda] Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Radkowski, Rafael] Iowa State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Karabulut-Ilgu, Aliye; Chen, An] Iowa State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Behzadan, Amir H.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Construct Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA";"Oregon State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station";Turkan, Y (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Sch Civil & Construct Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.;"yelda.turkan@oregonstate.edu; rafael@iastate.edu; aliye@iastate.edu; abehzadan@tamu.edu; achen@iastate.edu";Turkan, Yelda/AEW-5902-2022;"Turkan, Yelda/0000-0002-3224-5462; Karabulut-Ilgu, Aliye/0000-0003-3411-8261";;;;;86;76;82;1;45;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1474-0346;1873-5320;;ADV ENG INFORM;Adv.

Such an early introduction, however, has many challenges. This paper first presents a fall 2013 comparison of two Computer Science I (CSI) sections, leading to a conclusion emphasizing the importance of devoting sufficient time to a sufficiently small set of parallelism topics. Six additional CSI sections are then considered, offered from spring 2014 through spring 2016 by three different instructors. Five of these removed coverage of Java thread programming due to challenges found in fall 2013, only to show measurably reduced effectiveness of the parallelism module. Thus a new thread programming integration strategy is presented, as done in spring 2016. This strategy includes active out-of-class activities that split the disparate challenges of Java thread programming into distinct exercises. Results demonstrate improved student interest and learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J;Cremona, J;;;;Cremona, John;;;The L-Functions and Modular Forms Database Project;FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Database; L-functions; Modular forms";;The Langlands Programme, formulated by Robert Langlands in the 1960s and since much developed and refined, is a web of interrelated theory and conjectures concerning many objects in number theory, their interconnections, and connections to other fields. At the heart of the Langlands Programme is the concept of an L-function. The most famous L-function is the Riemann zeta function, and as well as being ubiquitous in number theory itself, L-functions have applications in mathematical physics and cryptography. Two of the seven Clay Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems, the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, deal with their properties. Many different mathematical objects are connected in various ways to L-functions, but the study of those objects is highly specialized, and most mathematicians have only a vague idea of the objects outside their specialty and how everything is related. Helping mathematicians to understand these connections was the motivation for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project. Its mission is to chart the landscape of L-functions and modular forms in a systematic, comprehensive, and concrete fashion. This involves developing their theory, creating and improving algorithms for computing and classifying them, and hence discovering new properties of these functions, and testing fundamental conjectures. In the lecture I gave a very brief introduction to L-functions for non-experts and explained and demonstrated how the large collection of data in the LMFDB is organized and displayed, showing the interrelations between linked objects, through our website www.lmfdb.org.

That difficulty stemmed from the requirement that algorithms be expressed in a vocabulary suited to the particular hardware available, ranging from function tables for the ENIAC to more conventional arithmetic and movement operations on later machines. Introduction of symbolic programming languages, exemplified by FORTRAN, solved a major difficulty for the next generation of computing devices by enabling specification of an algorithm in a form more suitable for human understanding, then translating this specification to a form executable by the machine. The programming language used for such specification bridged a semantic gap between the human and the computing device. It provided two important features: high-level abstractions, taking care of automated bookkeeping, and modularity, making it easier to reason about sub-parts of programs.;"[Valiron, Benoit] Univ Paris Sud, Engn Sch CentraleSupelec, Paris, France; [Valiron, Benoit] Univ Paris Sud, Comp Sci Lab, Paris, France; [Ross, Neil J.] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Selinger, Peter] Dalhousie Univ, Math, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Alexander, D.

We don't understand completely the causes but it has become clear that men and women have different perceptions of programming. The pedagogy of introductory programming courses should take these differences into account. In this study we analyze gender differences in an introductory programming course at the university level. Our results indicate that male and female students have different perceptions and learning outcomes: male students find programming easier, have a higher intention to program in the future and show higher learning outcomes than female students. To reduce these differences we have designed and implemented several learning modules using the principles of physical computing. The physical computing approach aims to take computational concepts out of the screen and into the real world so that students can interact with them. We have applied these modules in a MATLAB introductory programming course in a biology degree. When using these modules both male and female students showed similar results in perceptions and learning outcomes. The use of physical computing principles in combination with the traditional methodology reduced actually closed this gender gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The motivation for this study stems from our belief that many student difficulties can be alleviated by understanding the underlying causes of errors and by modifying the educational approach and, possibly, the teaching language accordingly. We analyze students' exercise submissions and categorize student errors according to compiler error messages and then manually according to the observed underlying cause. Our study complements earlier studies on the topic by applying computer and manual analysis while focusing on providing descriptive statistics of difficulties specific to FP languages. We conclude that the majority of student errors, regardless of cause, are reported by three different compiler error messages that are not well understood by students. In addition, syntactic features, such as precedence, the syntax of function application, and deeply nested statements, cause difficulties throughout the course.;"[Tirronen, Ville; Uusi-Makela, Samuel; Isomottonen, Ville] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Math Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland";University of Jyvaskyla;Tirronen, V (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Math Informat Technol, POB 35 Agora, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.;"ville.tirronen@jyu.fi; samuel.h.uusi-makela@student.jyu.fi; ville.isomottonen@jyu.fi";;Tirronen, Ville/0000-0002-5500-8267;;;;;55;11;11;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0956-7968;1469-7653;;J FUNCT PROGRAM;J.

This paper presents a contribution to the teaching of OOP languages through a game-oriented approach based on the interaction with tangible user interfaces (This). The use of a specific type of commercial distributed TUI (Sifteo cubes), in which several small physical devices have sensing, wireless communication and user-directed output capabilities, is applied to the teaching of the C# programming language, since the operation of these devices can be controlled by user programs written in C#. For our experiment, we selected a sample of students with a sufficient knowledge about procedural programming, which was divided into two groups: The first one had a standard introductory C# course, whereas the second one had an experimental C# course that included, in addition to the contents of the previous one, two demonstration programs that illustrated some OOP basic concepts using the TUI features. Finally, both groups completed two tests: a multiple-choice exam for evaluating the acquisition of basic OOP concepts and a C# programming exercise. The analysis of the results from the tests indicates that the group of students that attended the course including the TUI demos showed a higher interest level (i.e. they felt more motivated) during the course exposition than the one that attended the standard introductory C# course. Furthermore, the students from the experimental group achieved an overall better mark. Therefore, we can conclude that the technological contribution of Sifteo cubes - used as a distributed TUI by which OOP basic concepts are represented in a tangible and a visible way - to the teaching of the C# language has a positive influence on the learning of this language and such basic concepts.

On account of this, this study designs an online education algorithm based on AI technology to help teachers better understand the situation of students' online IPE teaching and improve the management of IPE in universities. Firstly, the learning features of students are extracted through the Back Propagation Neural Network (BP) model. This model summarizes the shortcomings of feature extraction in machine learning, and can simultaneously obtain depth information from the signals of multiple sensors, thus increasing the overall algorithm classification accuracy. Secondly, combined with the human behavior recognition model, the status and behavior of students' IPE teaching can be obtained in real-time from students' listening devices. Finally, the algorithm's classification performance is evaluated by experiments and compared with the designed model. The results reveal that the recognition accuracy of the designed classification algorithms for the sample students is 98.59%, 98.99%, 99.21%, 100%, 97.10%, 95.61%, and 100%, respectively. In addition, comparing the algorithm with similar recognition algorithms, its index values of accuracy and precision are 97.83% and 97.82%, respectively, which are better than similar classification algorithms. Finally, through the experimental samples, the accuracy of the human recognition model is tested and compared with other recognition models. The results reveal that the designed model has high recognition accuracy. This study is of great significance for improving teachers' innovative IPE methods and optimizing the management level of online IPE teaching.;"[Du, Gang] North Univ China, Sch Marxism, Taiyuan 030051, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yufeng] North Univ China, Sch Software, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yue] Taiyuan Normal Univ, Sch Marxism, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China";"North University of China; North University of China; Taiyuan Normal University";Du, G (corresponding author), North Univ China, Sch Marxism, Taiyuan 030051, Shanxi, Peoples R China.;DuGang5678123@yeah.net;;;"teaching reform and Innovation Project of colleges and universities of Shanxi Province: The seedling project: Practice research on the training mode of interdisciplinary innovative talents [J2021324]; Shanxi Province:Research on the innovation of Five-in-one teaching mode of ideological and political course for postgraduates [2021YJJG202]";"teaching reform and Innovation Project of colleges and universities of Shanxi Province: The seedling project: Practice research on the training mode of interdisciplinary innovative talents; Shanxi Province:Research on the innovation of Five-in-one teaching mode of ideological and political course for postgraduates";"The study was supported by the teaching reform and Innovation Project of colleges and universities of Shanxi Province: The seedling project: Practice research on the training mode of interdisciplinary innovative talents.

Therefore, complementing the academic concepts with practical and experiential learning is essential to optimize the learning outcomes. When daunting scientific principles and topics are implemented by traditional diagrams and equations, most students have trouble visualizing; restricting their ability to grasp the idea in detail. Augmented reality has recently become an engineering education method to teach abstract concepts as it enhances the visualization and understanding of technical concepts. In this paper, an augmented reality-based application, 'Hyperspace', was developed to enhance undergraduate students' spatial skills and conceptual knowledge in trigonometry. Hyperspace provides students with features such as augmenting three-dimensional trigonometric functions. These trigonometric functions are dynamically generated using procedural content generation algorithms and computer graphics in augmented reality. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Hyperspace on the spatial skills and conceptual knowledge of the students. In total, 127 first-year engineering students took part in the study, and they were randomly assigned to two groups.

Solar flares can disrupt communications and pose radiation risks to airline passengers. While traditional methods offer rough estimates of solar activity trends, the potential of artificial intelligence in this domain warrants exploration. This study addresses this research gap by evaluating the performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sunspot forecasting and assessing the suitability of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for solar event classification. Two publicly available datasets serve as the foundation for this research. To enhance algorithm performance through optimal hyperparameter selection, metaheuristic optimizers are employed. A unique contribution is the introduction of a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm, specifically tailored to the study's needs. Two experiments were conducted: In the first, RNNs predicted sunspot occurrence up to three steps ahead. The best-performing model, optimized using the introduced modified metaheuristic, achieved an impressive R-2 value of 0.840448, surpassing competing algorithms. In the second experiment, XGBoost models assessed solar flare severity, with the top model again optimized by the modified metaheuristic, achieving an accuracy of 0.981565. This novel approach highlights the potential for enhancing solar activity forecasting techniques and offers valuable insights into feature impacts on model decisions, thereby advancing our understanding of space weather.;"[Jovanovic, Luka; Bacanin, Nebojsa; Zivkovic, Miodrag; Sarac, Marko] Singidunum Univ, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Simic, Vladimir] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade 11010, Serbia; [Simic, Vladimir] Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Yuandong Rd, Taoyuan City 320315, Taiwan; [Mani, Joseph] Modern Coll Business & Sci, 3 Bawshar St, Muscat 133, Oman";"University of Belgrade; Yuan Ze University";Bacanin, N (corresponding author), Singidunum Univ, Danijelova 32, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.;"luka.jovanovic.191@signimail.rs; nbacanin@singidunum.ac.rs; vsima@sf.bg.ac.rs; drjosephmani@mcbs.edu.om; mzivkovic@singimail.rs; msarac@singidunum.ac.rs";"Bacanin, Nebojsa/L-5328-2019; Jovanovic, Luka/IWE-1949-2023; Simic, Vladimir/B-8837-2011; Zivkovic, Miodrag/AFC-8832-2022";"Bacanin, Nebojsa/0000-0002-2062-924X; Jovanovic, Luka/0000-0001-9402-7391; Simic, Vladimir/0000-0001-5709-3744; Zivkovic, Miodrag/0000-0002-4351-068X";"Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnoloscaron;kog Razvoja";"Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnoloscaron;kog Razvoja";No Statement Available;;63;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;2023 DEC 24;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00500-023-09496-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-023-09496-9;;DEC 2023;20;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;DL2E9;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001132125400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Numerous studies have gathered empirical data to explore the mental health impact of the pandemic on university students and investigate factors associated with higher levels of distress. While the online questionnaire survey has been a prevalent means to collect data, regression analysis has been observed a dominating approach to interpret and understand the impact of independent factors on a mental wellbeing state of interest. Drawbacks such as sensitivity to outliers, ineffectiveness in case of multiple predictors highly correlated may limit the use of regression in complex scenarios. These observations motivate the underlying research to propose alternative computational methods to investigate the questionnaire data. Inspired by recent machine learning advances, this research aims to construct a framework through feature permutation importance to empower the application of a variety of machine learning algorithms that originate from different computational frameworks and learning theories, including algorithms that cannot directly provide exact numerical contributions of individual factors. This would enable to explore quantitative impact of predictors in influencing student mental wellbeing from multiple perspectives as a result of using different algorithms, thus complementing the single view due to the dominant use of regression.

During this time, several generations of researchers have carried out research in this field. Accordingly, the approaches to solve problems of speech recognition have repeatedly undergone fundamental changes: the methods based on the recognition of individual sounds and parts of words using sets of rules obtained by expert means have given place to the methods of recognition and semantic interpretation of natural continuous speech based on mathematical models trained on large data sets. The review of the results begins with a description of the approach to building speech recognition systems, which was proposed by the head of the sector V.N. Trunin-Donskoy. The hardware-software approach has long been the calling card of the team and played a significant role in popularizing speech recognition and realizing the benefits of developing speech technologies in the Soviet Union. Solutions based on a combination of software and specialized hardware are now standard, but were new at that time. The development of the area, the complication of problems associated with the transition to discrete speech recognition with large dictionaries have resulted in the replacement of recognition methods based on the use of systems of expert rules with methods based on classical optimization algorithms, which were proposed and improved by the staff and graduate students of the team. Understanding the importance of the tasks of collecting, classifying, and annotating representative arrays of speech data was a feature of research at the Computing Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The work of the team members was significantly ahead of not only domestic but also modern foreign research in this area. A relevant area of applied work in the 1970s-1980s was the use of modern methods of digital speech processing, the creation of problem-oriented tools and language means that made it possible to simulate in real time the operation of components of speech recognition and signal processing systems, and in particular, interactive methods for filtering speech signals. The consistent increase in computing power and data corpus volumes has made it possible to move to the use of probabilistic speech modeling technologies, as well as the formulation and solution of natural speech recognition problems. Methods have been worked out and data corpuses and software systems have been developed for recognizing spontaneous speech, separating voices, determining gender, identifying key words in a speech stream, and classifying the subject of a speech message. Recent studies are related to the development of computationally efficient neural network methods and models for speech recognition and processing, which are intended for use in mobile devices.;"[Chuchupal, V.

Within the realm of education, there is growing recognition of the pivotal role played by computational thinking (CT). This skill set has emerged as indispensable in our ever-evolving digital landscape, accompanied by an equal need for effective methods to assess and measure these skills. This research places its focus on the Cross Array Task (CAT), an educational activity designed within the Swiss educational system to assess students' algorithmic skills. Its primary objective is to evaluate pupils' ability to deconstruct complex problems into manageable steps and systematically formulate sequential strategies. The CAT has proven its effectiveness as an educational tool in tracking and monitoring the development of CT skills throughout compulsory education. Additionally, this task presents an enthralling avenue for algorithmic research, owing to its inherent complexity and the necessity to scrutinise the intricate interplay between different strategies and the structural aspects of this activity. This task, deeply rooted in logical reasoning and intricate problem solving, often poses a substantial challenge for human solvers striving for optimal solutions. Consequently, the exploration of computational power to unearth optimal solutions or uncover less intuitive strategies presents a captivating and promising endeavour. This paper explores two distinct algorithmic approaches to the CAT problem. The first approach combines clustering, random search, and move selection to find optimal solutions. The second approach employs reinforcement learning techniques focusing on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model. The findings of this research hold the potential to deepen our understanding of how machines can effectively tackle complex challenges like the CAT problem but also have broad implications, particularly in educational contexts, where these approaches can be seamlessly integrated into existing tools as a tutoring mechanism, offering assistance to students encountering difficulties. This can ultimately enhance students' CT and problem-solving abilities, leading to an enriched educational experience.;"[Corecco, Samuel] Univ Svizzera Italiana USI, Fac Informat, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Adorni, Giorgia; Gambardella, Luca Maria] USI, Dalle Molle Inst Artificial Intelligence IDSIA, SUPSI, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland";"Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Universita della Svizzera Italiana";Adorni, G (corresponding author), USI, Dalle Molle Inst Artificial Intelligence IDSIA, SUPSI, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.;"samuel.corecco@usi.ch; giorgia.adorni@idsia.ch; luca.gambardella@usi.ch";Adorni, Giorgia/HKO-0870-2023;Adorni, Giorgia/0000-0002-2613-4467;Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF);Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF));No Statement Available;;63;0;0;1;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2504-4990;;MACH LEARN KNOW EXTR;Mach.

This big brain data, generated in different jurisdictions, is subject to distinct ethical and legal principles, giving rise to various ethical and legal concerns during collaborative efforts. Understanding these ethical and legal principles and concerns is crucial, as it catalyzes the development of a global governance framework, currently lacking in this field. While prior research has advocated for a contextual examination of brain data governance, such studies have been limited. Additionally, numerous challenges, issues, and concerns surround the development of a contextually informed brain data governance framework. Therefore, this study aims to bridge these gaps by exploring the ethical foundations that underlie contextual stakeholder discussions on brain data governance.MethodIn this study we conducted a secondary analysis of interviews with 21 neuroscientists drafted from the International Brain Initiative (IBI), LATBrain Initiative and the Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA) who are involved in various brain projects globally and employing ethical theories. Ethical theories provide the philosophical frameworks and principles that inform the development and implementation of data governance policies and practices.ResultsThe results of the study revealed various contextual ethical positions that underscore the ethical perspectives of neuroscientists engaged in brain data research globally.DiscussionThis research highlights the multitude of challenges and deliberations inherent in the pursuit of a globally informed framework for governing brain data.

The rising prevalence of depression emphasizes the importance of early detection and understanding the origins of such conditions. Objective: This paper proposes a framework for detecting depression using a hybrid visualization approach that combines local and global interpretation. This approach aims to assist in model adaptation, provide insights into patient characteristics, and evaluate prediction model suitability in a different environment. Methods: This study utilizes R programming language with the Caret, ggplot2, Plotly, and Dalex libraries for model training, visualization, and interpretation. Data from the NHANES repository was used for secondary data analysis. The NHANES repository is a comprehensive source for examining health and nutrition of individuals in the United States, and covers demographic, dietary, medication use, lifestyle choices, reproductive and mental health data. Penalized logistic regression models were built using NHANES 2015-2018 data, while NHANES 2019-March 2020 data was used for evaluation at the global-specific and local level interpretation. Results: The prediction model that supports this framework achieved an average AUC score of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.743-0.752), with minimal variability in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: The built-in prediction model highlights chest pain, the ratio of family income to poverty, and smoking status as crucial features for predicting depressive states in both the original and local environments.;"[Kopitar, Leon; Stiglic, Gregor] Univ Maribor, Fac Hlth Sci, Zitna Ul 15, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Kopitar, Leon; Kokol, Peter; Stiglic, Gregor] Univ Maribor, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Koroska Cesta 46, Maribor 2000, Slovenia; [Stiglic, Gregor] Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst, Teviot Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, Scotland";"University of Maribor; University of Maribor; University of Edinburgh";Kopitar, L (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Hlth Sci, Zitna Ul 15, Maribor 2000, Slovenia.;leon.kopitar1@um.si;"Kopitar, Leon/CAI-9779-2022; Stiglic, Gregor/E-5286-2011; Kokol, Peter/I-1542-2019";"Kopitar, Leon/0000-0002-6647-9988; Stiglic, Gregor/0000-0002-0183-8679; Kokol, Peter/0000-0003-4073-6488";Slovenian Re- search Agency [N3-0307, P2-0057];Slovenian Re- search Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia);The authors acknowledge partial support from the Slovenian Re- search Agency (grant numbers N3-0307 and P2-0057) .;;34;0;0;1;3;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1532-0464;1532-0480;;J BIOMED INFORM;J.

This study introduces the concept of autonomous services, a new service paradigm, and autonomous services systems, in which intelligent vehicles are vital enabling technology. Specifically, autonomous services aim to minimize unnecessary human participation and effort in the service process by leveraging intelligence for service delivery, rather than relying on simple stimulus-response or rule-based program behavior. This letter reports on the first Decentralized and Hybrid Workshop (DHW) on autonomous services, aiming to reduce the cost of human labor and improve the quality and efficiency of service while tackling the challenges posed by a shrinking workforce. The introduction of intelligent vehicles enhances the capability of the service systems, while also significantly increasing complexity. To address the challenges associated with complexity, the Systems Engineering (SE) approach is indispensable.

However, they also face a critical challenge in the form of high dropout rates. This paper addresses the need to identify students at risk of dropping out early in MOOCs, enabling course organizers to provide targeted support or adapt the course content to meet students' expectations. In this context, zero-time dropout predictors, which utilize demographic data before the course commences, hold significant potential. Despite a lack of consensus in the existing literature regarding the efficacy of demographic data in dropout prediction, this study delves into this issue to contribute new insights to the ongoing discourse. Through an extensive review of prior research and a detailed analysis of data acquired from two programming MOOCs, we aim to shed light on the relationship between students' demographic characteristics and their likelihood of early dropout from MOOCs, using logistic regression. This research extends the current understanding of the impact of demographic features on student retention. The results indicate that age, education level, student status, nationality, and disability can be used as predictors of dropout rate, though not in every course. The findings presented here are expected to affect the development of more effective strategies for reducing MOOC dropout rates, ultimately enhancing the educational experience for online learners.;"[Swacha, Jakub; Muszynska, Karolina] Univ Szczecin, Inst Management, PL-71454 Szczecin, Poland";University of Szczecin;Swacha, J (corresponding author), Univ Szczecin, Inst Management, PL-71454 Szczecin, Poland.;"jakub.swacha@usz.edu.pl; karolina.muszynska@usz.edu.pl";;Swacha, Jakub/0000-0002-2214-6989;;;;;54;0;0;2;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;NOV;2023;12;22;;;;;;;4674;10.3390/electronics12224674;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics12224674;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";Z9PW0;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001115336800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result, the need for a personalized recommendation classification model that can accurately assess and identify the individual student's social well-being has become increasingly important. This article will discuss the development of an adaptive personalized recommendation classification model for students' social well-being based on personality trait determinants. Social well-being is a field that analyses society, individual behavioural patterns, behavioural networks, and cultural elements of daily life. Social well-being develops critical thinking by understanding the social frameworks that affect humans by exposing the social basis of daily actions. For instance, when students are pleased, their academic achievement, behaviour, social integration, and happiness improve. This study classifies the effects of the Big 5 Personality Traits (Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, and Conscientiousness) on students' Industry 4.0 Social Well-being levels by analyzing their demographic and personality traits. A dataset was gathered through a survey distributed to students in a selected institution. The classifier's accuracy was assessed using the WEKA tool on a data set of 286 occurrences and 19 traits, and a confusion matrix was constructed. After analyzing the results of all algorithms, it was determined that the IBk and Randomizable Filtered Classifier algorithms give the best accuracy on social well-being readiness, with a comparable percentage value of 91.26%. The agreeableness personality trait, which represents a person's level of pleasantness, politeness, and helpfulness, had the greatest influence on the social well-being of the students. They have a positive outlook on human behaviour and get along well with others. Since social well-being contributes to a person's increased quality of life and happiness, improving students' current quality of life would lead to the development of a social parameter that can assess the growth of a country and the increased happiness of families and communities. Personality traits models have become an increasingly important tool for understanding and predicting human behavior. By analyzing different personality trait models, we can gain insights into how accurately and reliably they can predict individual behavior. This is especially useful in fields such as psychology, marketing, and recruitment, where understanding the nuances of individual personalities can be critical to success. In this study, how different personality trait models compare in terms of accuracy and reliability is explored using different machine learning algorithms using the WEKA tool. Personality trait models are increasingly being used to measure social well-being. This model is based on the idea that individuals' personalities are composed of a set of underlying traits which can be measured and compared. By understanding these traits, we can better understand the students' social well-being and how the environment around them may impact it.;"[Demong, Nur Atiqah Rochin; Shahrom, Melissa; Rahim, Ramita Abdul; Omar, Emi Normalina; Yahya, Mornizan] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Dept Technol & Supply Chain Management Studies, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia";Universiti Teknologi MARA;Demong, NAR (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Dept Technol & Supply Chain Management Studies, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.;"rochin@uitm.edu.my; melissa@uitm.edu.my; ramita@uitm.edu.my; emi128@uitm.edu.my; mornizan@uitm.edu.my";;;"Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Puncak Alam Campus [600-IRMI 5/3/DDF, 016/2019]; Faculty of Business and Management";"Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Puncak Alam Campus; Faculty of Business and Management";The authors would like to acknowledge the funding of the research by Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Selangor, Puncak Alam Campus via Dana Dalaman Fakulti (600-IRMI 5/3/DDF (FPP) (016/2019) .

However, existing research has not addressed the uncertain and dynamic features of students' cognitive status, whereas these features are essential for improving the accuracy of performance prediction. A novel approach via neutrosophic cognitive diagnosis is proposed to predict student performance in a personalized e-learning environment. This approach innovatively employs the neutrosophic set (NS) theory to comprehensively measure the students' cognitive status on knowledge concepts from three features, i.e., understanding level, degree of misunderstanding, and uncertainty. A new measurement method of NS similarity is used to identify top-k neighboring students for one student. Then, we predict a student's performance on exercises in future exams by integrating a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering algorithm with a probabilistic matrix factorization method to address the data sparsity problem. Finally, the experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach provides higher prediction accuracy than the existing ones with a low execution cost.;"[Ma, Hua; Huang, Zhuoxuan; Tang, Wensheng; Li, Jingze] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Haibin] Nipissing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Math, North Bay, ON P1B 8L7, Canada; [Zhang, Hongyu] Cent South Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China";"Hunan Normal University; Nipissing University; Central South University";Huang, ZX (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China.;"huamacsu@163.com; lilhzx@hunnu.edu.cn; tangws@hunnu.edu.cn; haibinz@nipissingu.ca; hyzhang@csu.edu.cn; jzli@hunnu.edu.cn";"Zhang, Hongyu/GQB-3142-2022; Ma, Hua/S-8911-2016";"Zhu, Haibin/0000-0003-1922-1631; Ma, Hua/0000-0002-1980-4709; Li, Jingze/0000-0003-1924-2870";"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62077014, 71971221]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2021JJ30886]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province)";This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62077014 and 71971221, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province under Grant 2021JJ30886.;;45;3;3;5;5;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

It also plays a critical role in complementing the curriculum. Many tertiary institutions provide various GC development activities (GCDA). Moreover, institutions strongly need to further understand student participation, especially its relationship to student backgrounds, activity profiles, and academic results. With the fast advancement of educational technologies and data mining, data analytics (DA) in formal learning and online education has been widely explored. However, there has been little work on student behavior in GCDA. To fill this gap and to provide new contributions, we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the interrelationship of GCDA participation and academic performance before and after higher education with significant and representative data (over 10 000 records) across three years. Hypotheses are formulated and validated, and the findings are triangulated with machine learning (ML) and DA. With supervised learning, the predictors of academic performance and GCDA participation are formulated, and the features to enhance predictions are analyzed. We develop predictors using novel approaches of genetic algorithms and Stacking in ML. The impacts of the breadth and depth of involvement are also studied. Results indicate that involvement in GCDA positively impacts student academic results. Our novel approaches give improvements in predicting student participation. Our holistic studies covering hypothesis validation, data analysis, and ML provide valuable insights into GCDA development.;"[So, Joseph Chi-Ho; Wong, Adam Ka-Lok; Wong, Simon Chi-Wang] Coll Profess & Continuing Educ, Div Sci Engn & Hlth Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ho, Yik Him; Chan, Henry C.

A pivotal metric in this realm is the Mental Health Assessment Index, a prevalent gauge utilized to ascertain an individual's psychological well-being. However, prevailing indices predominantly stem from a physical vantage point, neglecting the intricate psychological dimensions. In pursuit of a judicious evaluation of college students' mental health within the crucible of public health vicissitudes, we have pioneered an innovative metric, underscored by temporal perception, in concert with a hybrid clustering algorithm. This augmentation stands poised to enrich the extant psychological assessment index framework. Our approach hinges on the transmutation of temporal perception into a quantifiable measure, harmoniously interwoven with established evaluative metrics, thereby forging a novel composite evaluation metric. This composite metric serves as the fulcrum upon which we have conceived a pioneering clustering algorithm, seamlessly fusing the fireworks algorithm with K-means clustering. The strategic integration of the fireworks algorithm addresses a noteworthy vulnerability inherent to K-means-its susceptibility to converging onto local optima. Empirical validation of our paradigm attests to its efficacy. The proposed hybrid clustering algorithm aptly captures the dynamic nuances characterizing college students' mental health trajectories. Across diverse assessment stages, our model consistently attains an accuracy threshold surpassing 90%, thus outshining existing evaluation techniques in both precision and simplicity. In summation, this innovative amalgamation presents a formidable stride toward an augmented understanding of college students' mental well-being during times of fluctuating public health dynamics.;"[Li, Mao] Sichuan Vocat Coll Hlth & Rehabil, Zigong, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Fanfan] Huanggang Normal Univ, Student Affairs Dept, Huanggang, Hubei, Peoples R China";Huanggang Normal University;Li, FF (corresponding author), Huanggang Normal Univ, Student Affairs Dept, Huanggang, Hubei, Peoples R China.;lffxg@hgnu.edu.cn;;;;;;;34;0;0;2;8;PEERJ INC;LONDON;341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND;;2376-5992;;PEERJ COMPUT SCI;PeerJ Comput.

This research proposed a self-aware face emotion accelerated recognition algorithm (SFEARA) that improves the efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the recognition of facial emotions. SFEARA will recognize that critical and noncritical regions of input data perform high-precision computation and convolutive low-precision computation during the inference process, and finally combine the results, which can help us get the emotional recognition model for international students.

Different types of teachings and methods are envisioned and implemented to achieve this milestone. These methods include therapy and counseling, stress management, mediation, physical activities and creative activities. Music teaching is one of the methods that is used to improve the quality of human mental health. Initially, this research study defines the music teachings and the methods utilized for imparting music teachings. It elaborates on the importance of mental health, issues due to mental health, and their causes in college students. Second, it studies the relationship between music teachings and human physiology. It presents theories of human physiology and algorithms for measuring the quality of human mental health. Third, this study evaluates the impact of music teachings on the mental growth of adolescents and performs statistical analysis using big data in a three-tier fashion. It consists of the Assessment Session Check-In mental health test model, mental health analysis theory, and theory of favorable environment. The study also incorporates the 90-category symptom self-assessment analysis (SCL-90) and the self-measurement health rating analysis calculation method and uses SQL Server for statistical implementation. Finally, an evaluation study compares adolescents with and without music teachings using three parameters, i.e., physical health, mental health, and physiology. The statistical results are compared with results obtained from the existing statistical methods, which reveal that mental health gains are visible, with music study students outperforming ordinary students by 20% on the SCL-90 and having 14% higher mental health index scores. The comprehensive mental health score shows a significant 18% improvement over time. After two years of music instruction, the number of psychologically unwell pupils dropped by 28%, and extreme psychological issues has substantially decreased by 50% or more. This study can significantly improve students' understanding and approach to mental health, particularly in music education. It provides compelling evidence of the positive impact of music study on mental well-being, potentially influencing educational practices and policies.;[Wang, Linglu] Guilin Univ, Dept Teaching Affairs & Integrat Ind & Educ, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China;;Wang, LL (corresponding author), Guilin Univ, Dept Teaching Affairs & Integrat Ind & Educ, Guilin 541006, Guangxi, Peoples R China.;wanglinglu66@163.com;;;"2022's Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project Integrated Design and Practice of Ideological and Political Education in Programming Courses under the Background of New Engineering [2022JGA406]; 2021's Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project Research on the construction and practice of data literacy curriculum system under the background of Four Newconstruction; Guangxi higher education undergraduate teaching reform project research result [2021JGB449]";"2022's Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project Integrated Design and Practice of Ideological and Political Education in Programming Courses under the Background of New Engineering; 2021's Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project Research on the construction and practice of data literacy curriculum system under the background of Four Newconstruction; Guangxi higher education undergraduate teaching reform project research result";"& nbsp;This study was funded by 2022's Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project Integrated Design and Practice of Ideological and Political Education in Programming Courses under the Background of New Engineering(2022JGA406); 2021's Guangxi Higher Education Undergraduate Teaching Reform Project Research on the construction and practice of data literacy curriculum system under the background of Four Newconstruction.

Nevertheless, identifying the student's progress is highly complicated due to the large number of students and the lack of direct interaction. Artificial intelligence algorithms contribute to overcoming this problem by automatically analyzing the features and interactions of each student with the e-learning platform. The main limitations of the previous proposals are that they do not consider a ranking between the different marks obtained by students and the most accurate models are usually black boxes without comprehensibility. This paper proposes to use an optimized ordinal classification algorithm, FlexNSLVOrd, that performs a prediction of student's performance in four ranking classes (Withdrawn < Fail < Pass < Distinction) by generating highly understandable models. The experimental study uses the OULA dataset and compares 10 state-of-the-art methods on 7 different courses and 3 classical classification metrics. The results, validated with statistical analysis, show that FlexNSLVOrd has higher performance than the other models and achieves significant differences with the rest of the proposals. In addition, the interpretability of FlexNSLVOrd is compared with other rule-based models, and simpler and more representative rules are obtained.;"[Gamez-Granados, Juan C.; Rodriguez-Lozano, Francisco J.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Esteban, Aurora; Zafra, Amelia] Univ Cordoba, Dept Comp Sci & Numer Anal, Andalusian Res Inst Data Sci & Computat Intellige, Cordoba 14071, Spain";"Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba";Zafra, A (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Comp Sci & Numer Anal, Andalusian Res Inst Data Sci & Computat Intellige, Cordoba 14071, Spain.;"jcgamez@uco.es; aestebant@uco.es; fj.rodriguez@uco.es; azafra@uco.es";"Rodriguez-Lozano, Francisco Javier/AAC-7276-2019; Zafra, Amelia/H-5714-2019; Esteban, Aurora/AAL-9987-2021";"Rodriguez-Lozano, Francisco Javier/0000-0003-3560-1407; Zafra, Amelia/0000-0003-3868-6143;";"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation; European Regional Development Fund [PID2020-115832GB-I00]";"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU))";Funding for open access charge: University of Cordoba/CBUA.

The innovativeness of the higher education system is not always reflected through optimal educational content, innovative study programs, skills improvement, assessment methods, etc. The study aims to analyze and evaluate how selected internal factors, reflected in organizational support for innovativeness of HEIs, and external factors reflected in government support for innovativeness of HEIs determine the innovativeness of HEIs, as one of the key determinants of economic prosperity.Design/methodology/approachThe authors analyzed three facets of higher education innovativeness, i.e. graduates' employability, entrepreneurial competencies and new ways of assessment. The sample included 664 students from the University of Kragujevac, Serbia, and the University of Maribor, Slovenia. The authors applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine relations.FindingsThe results clearly show that in order to become the driver of development in emerging economies, universities must act in different directions, focusing on different organizational drivers of innovativeness, such as academic autonomy of teachers, student participation in curricula design, enhancing new ideas and compensation system, provide resources etc. Organizational support and government for innovativeness of HEIs affect students' entrepreneurial and social skills, creative thinking, leadership, interactive competencies and knowledge-skill-attitude. Assessment tasks and associated learning should be redesigned to enable students to be involved in the evaluation of their work.Originality/valueThe study strives to reduce the research gap identified in the field of researching the drivers of innovativeness in higher education and offers implications for emerging markets regarding various factors that determine the innovativeness of HEIs and consequently contribute to fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in emerging markets. Originality derives from the fact that even though the authors have explored HEIs in Serbia and Slovenia, the results are fully transferrable to other former socialist states, considering their similar socio-economic and educational background.

Moreover, it affects the harmony of the family and stability of the society. This phenomenon has attracted great attention from the society. New technological paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data mining offer new opportunities to detect, assess, and care for the mental health of students early. This paper explains the psychological problems of college students and analyzes the application of IoT and data mining in the mental health of students. The contents of mental health in colleges are investigated, and big data techniques are employed to build an innovative model for students. First, an online psychological consulting platform is designed followed by online evaluation standards and online/offline teaching fusion courses to understand mental health. Next, a neural network algorithm is developed and trained on the datasets to accurately classify the contents of students' mental health, and the corresponding results are obtained. The model is evaluated in terms of accuracy. Results show that the proposed innovative model achieves better results with 88% accuracy.

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has recently emerged as a popular research topic as people are increasingly attempting to know the manner in which AI algorithms attain results. In this context, understanding and analyzing the optimization processes of EAs to effectively enhance their performance are crucial and challenging tasks. Most traditional visualization methods focus on dimensionality reduction, visualization of the fitness landscape and the optimization process for a particular algorithm. This study represents the first attempt at establishing a comprehensive dynamic visualization tool, Evo-Panel, that can directly and flexibly illustrate the detailed procedures of different optimization algorithms in solving numerical benchmark functions. The objective is to help users identify the influence of the design formulas, operations, and parameters on the capabilities and performances of the algorithms. Using Evo-Panel, users can trace each movement, observe the process in an intuitive manner, and interpret the processes related to EAs, which are important to XAI. Moreover, Evo-Panel can be used to perform a comparative analysis to illustrate the differences between algorithms. Results of case studies demonstrate that the use of Evo-Panel can allow professors to explain optimization algorithms in a visually interesting manner and facilitate the students' understanding of EAs. The tool can promote CI-related education from teaching and learning perspectives. Furthermore, researchers can use it to obtain information for analysis, facilitate debugging, verify design ideas, gain insights into the process, and enhance the design of EAs.;"[Kuo, Shu-Yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Theoret Phys & IBM Quantum Hub, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kuo, Shu-Yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Theoret Phys & IBM Quantum Hub, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Jiang, Yu-Chi] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Hua, Cheng-Yen; Chou, Yao-Hsin] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Nantou 54561, Taiwan; [Chou, Yao-Hsin] Natl Ctr Theoret Sci, Phys Div, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Kuo, Sy-Yen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Kuo, Sy-Yen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Quantum Sci & Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan";"National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Chi Nan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University";"Chou, YH (corresponding author), Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Nantou 54561, Taiwan.;Chou, YH (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Theoret Sci, Phys Div, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.";"shuyu@ntu.edu.tw; d08921017@ntu.edu.tw; s111321901@mail1.ncnu.edu.tw; yhchou@ncnu.edu.tw; sykuo@ntu.edu.tw";;"Kuo, Shu-Yu/0000-0002-9780-0738; Hua, Cheng-Yen/0009-0007-6106-9588; Kuo, Sy-Yen/0000-0002-3021-8321; Jiang, Yu-Chi/0000-0003-0489-9896";"National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan [109-2222-E-005-002-MY3, 111-2221-E-260-014-MY2, 111-2627-M-002-001, 111-2119-M-033-001, 111-2221-E-002-133-MY3]; Academia Sinica; National Center for Theoretical Sciences of Taiwan";"National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan; Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); National Center for Theoretical Sciences of Taiwan";This work was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan under Grants 109-2222-E-005-002-MY3, 111-2221-E-260-014-MY2, 111-2627-M-002-001, 111-2119-M-033-001, and 111-2221-E-002-133-MY3, in part by Academia Sinica, and in part by the National Center for Theoretical Sciences of Taiwan.;;57;2;2;4;5;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2471-285X;;;IEEE T EM TOP COMP I;IEEE Trans.

However, students' initiatives in this field fall short of the desired standards. The current evaluation index system is insufficient for meeting the developmental needs of colleges and universities. Therefore, exploring innovative approaches and implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework become crucial. This research analyzes the limitations of the current evaluation system, which focuses on curriculum, teaching materials, management, research output, student employment, entrepreneurship awareness, and participation. Unfortunately, this narrow approach has a significant impact on the quality of education in this field. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel evaluation system for assessing students' innovation and entrepreneurship education by utilizing the capabilities of backpropagation (BP) neural network. We researched the conceptual framework, components, and learning process of BP neural network. Additionally, we provide a thorough description of the calculation process and structure of the BP neural network algorithm by facilitating stakeholders' understanding. Our study aims to strengthen the landscape of education by developing a culture of excellence. We developed a robust evaluation system with well-defined indexes calibrated to capture the essence of this education. Through precise training and analysis, we achieved remarkable results, with a maximum difference of 1.6% between the anticipated and actual output. This highlights the accuracy of our model in assessing teaching quality. We also thoroughly compared several kinds of assessment methods for the growth of students' entrepreneurial and innovative skills that have been presented in the literature. Based on the simulation results, we discovered that our model performs better as compared to the existing model. Based on the evidence, innovation and entrepreneurship education in Chinese institutions can be characterized as moderate. This finding lays the foundation for further advancements, fostering a future where educational excellence and entrepreneurial spirit thrive.;"[He, Mengxing] China Univ Min & Technol, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinliang] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China";"China University of Mining & Technology; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications";Zhang, JL (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.;"Mengxing.HE@outlook.com; zhang_jinliang241@163.com";;;;;;;36;1;1;5;19;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;OCT;2023;27;19;;;;;14361;14377;;10.1007/s00500-023-09079-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-023-09079-8;;AUG 2023;17;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;T0KE2;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001046961000002;View Full Record in Web of Science

This data is stored for later use in the instructional module. Designing a student model is not an easy task. It is first necessary to identify the knowledge acquired by the learner, then identify the learner's level of understanding of the functionality and finally identify the pedagogical strategies used by the learner to solve a problem. These elements must be taken into account in the development of the learner model. Learner characteristics must be considered in several forms. To build an effective learner model, the system must take into consideration both static (Learner preferences) and dynamic (Compartmental action) student characteristics. The objective of the article is to work out the learner model of the intelligent tutoring system by suggesting a new learning path. This proposal is based on the constructivist approach and the activist style (based on experimentation). According to the KOLB model, the authors propose a list of pedagogical activities depending on the learners' profile. Based on the learners' actions, the system reduces the list of activities based on two criteria: the learner's preference and the presence of one or more activities based on the activist style using genetic algorithm as an evolutionary algorithm. The results obtained led us to improve the learning process through a new conception of the ITS learner model.;"[Hibbi, Fatima-Zohra] EMSI Rabat, SMARTiLAB, Rabat, Morocco; [Hibbi, Fatima-Zohra; Abdoun, Otman; Haimoudi, El Khatir] Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Polydisciplinary Fac, Adv Sci & Technol Lab, Larache, Morocco";Abdelmalek Essaadi University of Tetouan;"Hibbi, FZ (corresponding author), EMSI Rabat, SMARTiLAB, Rabat, Morocco.;Hibbi, FZ (corresponding author), Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Polydisciplinary Fac, Adv Sci & Technol Lab, Larache, Morocco.";;"Abdoun, Otman/AAG-5172-2020; HIBBI, fatima-zohra/CAJ-2808-2022";HIBBI, fatima-zohra/0000-0003-3385-5809;;;;;18;0;0;1;2;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

Although all schools try to accentuate good attendance, still some schools find it hard to achieve the required level (96% in UK) of average attendance. The most productive way of increasing the pupils & PRIME; attendance rate is to predict when it is going to go down, understand the reasons-why it happened-and act on the affecting factors so as to prevent it. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an automated machine learning solution for different types of problems. Several machine learning (ML) models like logistic regression, decision trees, etc. are easy to understand; however, complicated (Neural Network, BART etc.) ML models are not transparent but are black-boxes for humans. It is not always evident how machine intelligence arrived at a decision. However, not always, but in critical applications it is important that humans can understand the reasons for such decisions. In this paper, we present a methodology on the application example of pupil attendance for constructing explanations for AI classification algorithms. The methodology includes building a model of the application in the Isabelle Insider and Infrastructure framework (IIIf) and an algorithm (PCR) that helps us to obtain a detailed logical rule to specify the performance of the black-box algorithm, hence allowing us to explain it. The explanation is provided within the logical model of the IIIf, thus is suitable for human audiences. It has been shown that the RR-cycle of IIIf can be adapted to provide a method for iteratively extracting an explanation by interleaving attack tree analysis with precondition refinement, which finally yields a general rule that describes the decision taken by a black-box algorithm produced by Artificial intelligence.";"[Kammuller, Florian; Satija, Dimpy] Middlesex Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, London NW4 4BT, England";Middlesex University;Kammüller, F (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ London, Dept Comp Sci, London NW4 4BT, England.;"f.kammueller@mdx.ac.uk; d.satija@live.mdx.ac.uk";;Kammueller, Florian/0000-0001-5839-5488;;;;;40;1;1;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;AUG;2023;14;8;;;;;;;453;10.3390/info14080453;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info14080453;;;17;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;Q3IO8;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001056487300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The development of social knowledge constructs and critical thinking can be represented by cognitive presence, which is a primary component of the community of inquiry model. However, identifying learners' cognitive presence is a challenging problem, and most researchers have performed this task using traditional machine learning methods that require both manual feature construction and adequate labeled data. In this article, we present a novel variant of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model for cognitive presence identification, namely MOOC-BERT, which is pretrained on large-scale unlabeled discussion data collected from various MOOCs involving different disciplines. MOOC-BERT learned deep representations of unlabeled data and adopted Chinese characters as inputs without any feature engineering. The experimental results showed that MOOC-BERT outperformed the representative machine learning algorithms and deep learning models in the performance of identification and cross-course generalization. Then, MOOC-BERT was adopted to identify the unlabeled posts of the two courses. The empirical analysis results revealed the evolution and differences in MOOC learners' cognitive presence levels. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of pretraining on large-scale and multidiscipline discussion data in facilitating accurate cognitive presence identification, demonstrating the practical value of MOOC-BERT in learning analytics.;"[Liu, Zhi; Kong, Xi; Chen, Hao; Liu, Sannyuya; Yang, Zongkai] Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Elearning, Natl Engn Lab Educ Big Data, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China";Central China Normal University;Kong, X (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Elearning, Natl Engn Lab Educ Big Data, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;"zhiliu@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; kongxicc@mails.ccnu.edu.cn; zuoyouhr@mails.ccnu.edu.cn; lsy5918@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; 13659885363@163.com";Liu, Zhi/AAX-5684-2021;"Liu, Zhi/0000-0001-5024-9056; Liu, Sannyuya/0000-0002-4926-3720";"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62077017, 61977030, 61937001, 62007020]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [CCNU22LJ005]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)";This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62077017, Grant 61977030, Grant 61937001, and Grant 62007020, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant CCNU22LJ005.;;61;10;10;34;73;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students' attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition.

Firstly, a bi-directional residual BiRes2Net module is proposed to achieve bi-directional multi-scale expression feature extraction at the fine-grained level, while a short-directed connection path is introduced to make the network have the self-closing capability and avoid extracting redundant information of expressions; Then the Fine-Grained Coordinate Attention (FGCA) mechanism is embedded to extract expression spatial location features and channel features at a fine-grained level by making full use of the prior knowledge of facial expressions; Finally, a multi-classification Focalloss loss function is used to alleviate the imbalance of expression data, and different weights are assigned to expression samples with different recognition difficulty so that the network is biased towards difficult sample feature extraction.

While both procedures use Tc-99m-isotopes, the two vary in signal and background intensity. To understand how the different levels of image guidance impact surgical decision-making, computer-vision algorithms are used to extract the DROP-IN probe kinematic form clinical videos. 44 PCa patients undergo SLN (25) and PSMA-targeted (19) resections. PSMA-PET/CT and SPECT/CT create preoperative roadmaps, and intraoperative probe signal intensities are recorded. Using neural network-based software, probe trajectories are extracted from videos to extract multiparametric kinematics and generate decision-making and dexterity scores. PSMA-targeted resections yield significantly lower nodal signal intensities in preoperative SPECT-CT scans (three-fold; p = 0.01), intraoperative probe readouts (eight-fold; p < 0.001), and signal-to-background ratios (SBR; two-fold; p < 0.001). Kinematics assessment reveal that the challenges encounter during PSMA-targeted procedures converted to longer target identification times and increase in probe pick-ups (both five-fold; p < 0.001). This results in a fourfold reduction in the decision-making score (p < 0.001). Reduced signal intensities and intraoperative SBR values negatively affect the impact that image-guided surgery strategies have on the surgical decision-making process.";"[Azargoshasb, Samaneh; Rietbergen, Daphne D.

The main challenge for these classes was conducting risky and complex chemical or biological experiments in a domestic environment. To address this challenge, a smart experiment system called MRLab was developed. MRLab used wearables such as a smart glove and head-mounted device to record sensory data and a multimodal hybrid fusion model GVVS to interpret the user's experimental intent, which essentially transforms the user's abstract behavioral actions into a probabilistic set of experimental intent that can be computed. Different experiments in MRLab used different libraries of experimental intents. The SrNet model in GVVS was used to estimate the probability of the user's gesture behavior generated from the smart glove, while the SIPA algorithm compared speech information entered during the experiment with the experimental intent library to estimate the probability of the user's intent. At the same time, the scene visual channel monitored the information about the object the user intended to operate, with the SVF algorithm computing the probability of the intended object in real-time. The results from ANOVA and post-hoc comparative testing conducted on 21 volunteers revealed that MRLab outperformed other experiment modes, including WEB, AR, and VR, with a higher intention understanding rate, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Therefore, MRLab proved to be a useful alternative to traditional physics laboratory experiments during the pandemic, along with being an additional teaching tool for remote learning purposes.;"[Wang, Hongyue; Feng, Zhiquan; Yang, Xiaohui; Zhou, Liran; Tian, Jinglan; Guo, Qingbei] Univ Jinan, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongyue; Feng, Zhiquan; Yang, Xiaohui; Zhou, Liran; Tian, Jinglan; Guo, Qingbei] Univ Jinan, Shandong Prov Key Lab Network Based Intelligent Co, Jinan, Peoples R China";"University of Jinan; University of Jinan";Feng, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Jinan, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan, Peoples R China.;ise_fengzq@ujn.edu.cn;周, 丽然/GYU-4729-2022;;Independent Innovation Team Project of Jinan City [2019GXRC013];Independent Innovation Team Project of Jinan City;This paper is supported by the Independent Innovation Team Project of Jinan City (No. 2019GXRC013).;;49;1;1;8;22;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;1044-7318;1532-7590;;INT J HUM-COMPUT INT;Int.

Justification and transparency represent two crucial goals in explainable recommendations. Different from transparency, which faithfully exposes the reasoning behind the recommendation mechanism, justification conveys a conceptual model that may differ from that of the underlying algorithm. An explanation is an answer to a question. In explainable recommendation, a user would want to ask questions (referred to as intelligibility types) to understand the results given by an RS. In this paper, we identify relationships between Why and How explanation intelligibility types and the explanation goals of justification and transparency. We followed the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach and leveraged the What-Why-How visualization framework to systematically design and implement Why and How visual explanations in the transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA). Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative user study (N = 12) based on a thematic analysis of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interviews with students and researchers to investigate the potential effects of providing Why and How explanations together in an explainable RS on users' perceptions regarding transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Our study shows qualitative evidence confirming that the choice of the explanation intelligibility types depends on the explanation goal and user type.;"[Guesmi, Mouadh; Chatti, Mohamed Amine; Joarder, Shoeb; Ain, Qurat Ul; Siepmann, Clara; Ghanbarzadeh, Hoda; Alatrash, Rawaa] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Engn, Social Comp Grp, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany";University of Duisburg Essen;Chatti, MA (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Engn, Social Comp Grp, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.;mohamed.chatti@uni-due.de;;"Joarder, Shoeb/0000-0003-4591-9742; Ain, Qurat Ul/0000-0003-2691-0267; Chatti, Mohamed Amine/0000-0002-1311-7852; Guesmi, Mouadh/0000-0002-4105-8896; Siepmann, Clara/0009-0007-0480-9690; Alatrash, Rawaa/0000-0003-2192-028X";German Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 2167];German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG));The authors thank the German Research Foundation (DFG) for partly funding this work under grant No. GRK 2167, Research Training Group User-Centred Social Media.;;65;3;3;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;JUL;2023;14;7;;;;;;;401;10.3390/info14070401;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info14070401;;;22;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;N7DH9;;gold, Green Submitted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001038569500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this, various tools such as content versioning systems, workflow management systems, and software environment management systems have been developed. While these tools are becoming more widely used, there is still much work to be done to increase their adoption. The most effective way to ensure reproducibility becomes a standard part of most bioinformatics data analysis projects is to integrate it into the curriculum of bioinformatics Master's programs. Results In this article, we present the Reprohackathon, a Master's course that we have been running for the last 3 years at Universite Paris-Saclay (France), and that has been attended by a total of 123 students. The course is divided into two parts. The first part includes lessons on the challenges related to reproducibility, content versioning systems, container management, and workflow systems. In the second part, students work on a data analysis project for 3-4 months, reanalyzing data from a previously published study. The Reprohackaton has taught us many valuable lessons, such as the fact that implementing reproducible analyses is a complex and challenging task that requires significant effort. However, providing in-depth teaching of the concepts and the tools during a Master's degree program greatly improves students' understanding and abilities in this area.;"[Cokelaer, Thomas] Univ Paris Cite, Inst Pasteur, Plate Forme Technol Biom, F-75015 Paris, France; [Cokelaer, Thomas; Lemoine, Frederic] Univ Paris Cite, Inst Pasteur, Bioinformat & Biostat Hub, F-75015 Paris, France; [Cohen-Boulakia, Sarah] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Sci Numer, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Lemoine, Frederic] Univ Paris Cite, Inst Pasteur, G5 Evolutionary Genom RNA Viruses, F-75015 Paris, France";"Pasteur Network; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris; Pasteur Network; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; Pasteur Network; Universite Paris Cite; Institut Pasteur Paris";"Lemoine, F (corresponding author), Univ Paris Cite, Inst Pasteur, Bioinformat & Biostat Hub, F-75015 Paris, France.;Cohen-Boulakia, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Sci Numer, F-91405 Orsay, France.";"sarah.cohen-boulakia@universite-paris-saclay.fr; frederic.lemoine@pasteur.fr";Cokelaer, Thomas/AAN-8240-2020;"Cokelaer, Thomas/0000-0001-6286-1138; Lemoine, Frederic/0000-0001-9576-4449; COHEN-BOULAKIA, Sarah/0000-0002-7439-1441";"SaclAI-School project [ANR-22-CMAS-0008]; France Genomique [ANR-10-INBS-09]; IBISA";"SaclAI-School project; France Genomique; IBISA";This work was supported in part by the SaclAI-School project (ANR-22-CMAS-0008).

AMSs enable real-time monitoring of udder health and milk quality during each milking episode, which provides a wealth of data that can be utilized to optimize herd management practices. ML algorithms are well-suited for handling large and multi-dimensional datasets, making them a valuable tool for analyzing the vast amount of data generated by AMSs. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize the milk productivity of Holstein Friesians cows milked by AMSs during individual lactation periods and evaluate their stability over time. Four unsupervised ML clustering algorithms were employed to cluster the cows within each lactation period, and a merging index was proposed to combine the clustering results. The dairy cows were grouped into clusters based on their productivity, and the stability of these Productivity Groups (PGs) over time was analyzed. The PGs were found to be weakly stable over time, indicating that selecting cows for insemination based solely on their present or past lactation productivity may not be the most effective strategy. In addition, the results revealed that the High Productivity Group exhibited lower levels of protein, fat, and lactose content in the milk. The proposed methodology was demonstrated using data from one farm with dairy cows that exclusively uses the AMS, however, it can be applied to any context and dataset in which a multi-algorithm clustering analysis is suitable, including data from conventional milking parlors. Understanding milk productivity and its factors in future lactation periods is essential for effective herd management. A comprehensive long-term analysis is of significant importance for the zootechnical sector as it could assists farmers in selecting cows for insemination and making decisions on which ones to retain for future lactation periods.;"[Rebuli, Karina Brotto; Ozella, Laura; Giacobini, Mario] Univ Torino, Dept Vet Sci, Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Vanneschi, Leonardo] Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVA Informat Management Sch, Lisbon, Portugal";"University of Turin; Universidade Nova de Lisboa";Ozella, L (corresponding author), Univ Torino, Dept Vet Sci, Grugliasco, TO, Italy.;laura.ozella@unito.it;"Ozella, Laura/KVY-0571-2024; Vanneschi, Leonardo/U-8470-2017";"Giacobini, Mario/0000-0002-7647-5649; Vanneschi, Leonardo/0000-0003-4732-3328";"Compagnia di San Paolo [ROL 63369 SIME 2020.1713]; national funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), under the project -Centro de Investigacao em Gestao de Informacao (MagIC)/NOVA IMS [UIDB/04152/2020]";"Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo); national funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), under the project -Centro de Investigacao em Gestao de Informacao (MagIC)/NOVA IMS";This study is supported by Compagnia di San Paolo (ROL 63369 SIME 2020.1713) and by national funds through FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), under the project - UIDB/04152/2020 - Centro de Investigacao em Gestao de Informacao (MagIC)/NOVA IMS.;;26;0;0;1;5;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0168-1699;1872-7107;;COMPUT ELECTRON AGR;Comput.

SonOpt has already introduced benefits on the understanding of algorithmic behaviour by proposing the use of sound as a medium for the process monitoring of bi-objective optimisation algorithms. The first edition of SonOpt utilised two different sonification paths to provide information on convergence, population diversity, recurrence of objective values across consecutive generations and the shape of the approximation set. The present extension provides further insight through the introduction of a third sonification path, which involves hypervolume contributions to facilitate the understanding of the relative importance of non-dominated solutions. Using a different sound generation approach than the existing ones, this newly proposed sonification path utilizes pitch deviations to highlight the distribution of hypervolume contributions across the approximation set. To demonstrate the benefits of SonOpt we compare the sonic results obtained from two popular population-based multi-objective optimisation algorithms, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), and use a Multi-objective Random Search (MRS) approach as a baseline. The three algorithms are applied to numerous test problems and showcase how sonification can reveal various aspects of the optimisation process that may not be obvious from visualisation alone.

J;"Hopman, K; Richards, D; Norberg, MM";;;;"Hopman, Katherine; Richards, Deborah; Norberg, Melissa M.";;;A Digital Coach to Promote Emotion Regulation Skills;MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERACTION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"embodied conversational agent; emotion regulation; design; digital coach";MODEL;There is growing awareness that effective emotion regulation is critical for health, adjustment and wellbeing. Emerging evidence suggests that interventions that promote flexible emotion regulation may have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in specific at-risk populations. The challenge is how best to engage with at risk populations, who may not be actively seeking assistance, to deliver this early intervention approach. One possible solution is via digital technology and development, which has rapidly accelerated in this space. Such rapid growth has, however, occurred at the expense of developing a deep understanding of key elements of successful program design and specific mechanisms that influence health behavior change. This paper presents a detailed description of the design, development and evaluation of an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) who acts as a digital coach. ERICA uses interactive conversation to encourage self-reflection and to support and empower users to learn a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies including Refocusing, Reappraisal, Planning and Putting into Perspective. A pilot evaluation of ERICA was conducted with 138 university students and confirmed that ERICA provided a feasible and highly usable method for delivering an emotion regulation intervention. The results also indicated that ERICA was able to develop a therapeutic relationship with participants and increase their intent to use a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies. These findings suggest that ERICA holds potential to be an effective approach for delivering an early intervention to support mental health and wellbeing. ERICA's dialogue, embedded with interactivity, therapeutic alliance and empathy cues, provide the basis for the development of other psychoeducation interventions.;"[Hopman, Katherine; Richards, Deborah] Macquarie Univ, Sch Comp, 4 Res Pk Dr, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Norberg, Melissa M.] Macquarie Univ, Australian Hearing Hub, Ctr Emot Hlth, Level 1, 16 Univ Ave, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia";"Macquarie University; Macquarie University; Hearing Australia";Richards, D (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sch Comp, 4 Res Pk Dr, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;"katherine.hopman@students.mq.edu.au; deborah.richards@mq.edu.au; melissa.norberg@mq.edu.au";"Norberg, Melissa M/H-8365-2014; Richards, Deborah/ABV-4798-2022";Richards, Deborah/0000-0002-7363-1511;;;;;63;2;2;6;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2414-4088;;MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOG;Multimodal Technol.

New classes (in the terminology of object-oriented programming) are proposed and implemented in the popular programming language 'Python.' These classes, along with the symbolic computation module of Python 'sympy,' enable one to reduce the solution of a large class of problems in undergraduate engineering mechanics to a set of Python statements. These statements are definitions of objects as instances of the proposed classes and calling of their relevant methods. If the thought process in the manual solution is represented by a flowchart, the present work can be viewed as a flowchart translator. As all the calculations are automatically performed, the present work relieves the student from the burden and fear of lengthy calculations. Different diagrammatic representations of velocity, acceleration, shear force, and bending moments are included for better physical understanding. It is believed that the proposed simple implementation would make problem-solving and the learning process more enjoyable. Apart from a standard PC, the proposed work runs on a single-board computer (tested in raspberry pi 4) and on an Android mobile device. A student feedback study ascertains the acceptability of the proposed method.;"[Ghosh, Sunavo] Tata Metaliks, Robot Div, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Kundu, Soumalya; Neogy, Sumanta; Nandi, Arghya] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Nandi, Arghya] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India";"Jadavpur University; Jadavpur University";Nandi, A (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India.;nandi.arghya@gmail.com;;Ghosh, Sunavo/0000-0002-1155-5330;;;;;16;1;1;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

For evaluating that the OOP principles have been correctly applied to a real application, we use unit testing. In this paper, we focus on prioritizing that the students understand and apply correctly complex OOP principles and that they design properly the classes (including their relationships). In addition, we focus on the Python programming language rather than the typical previous works' focus in this area. Thus, we present a real case study of a practical assignment, in which the students have to implement characters for a video game. This assignment has the particularities and advantages that it is incremental and that it applies all four OOP principles within a single assignment. We also present its solution with the UML class diagram description. Furthermore, we provide unit testing for this case study and give general advice for generalizing the unit tests to other real case scenarios. Finally, we corroborate the effectiveness of our approach with positive student evaluations.;"[Climent, Laura; Arbelaez, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Madrid UAM, Dept Ingn Informat, Madrid, Spain";;Climent, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid UAM, Dept Ingn Informat, Madrid, Spain.;laura.climent@uam.com;"Arbelaez, Alejandro/N-1633-2016; Climent, Laura/AAU-6800-2021";"Arbelaez, Alejandro/0000-0003-1622-5645; Climent, Laura/0000-0001-9453-5150";;;;;20;1;1;1;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

These technologies provide massive and multidimensional information for teaching research, but at the same time, the information obtained by teachers and students presents an explosive increase. Extracting the core content of the class record text through text summarization technology to generate concise class minutes can significantly improve the efficiency of teachers and students to obtain information. This article proposes a hybrid-view class minutes automatic generation model (HVCMM). The HVCMM model uses a multilevel encoding strategy to encode the long text of the input class records to avoid memory overflow in the calculation after the long text is input into the single-level encoder. The HVCMM model uses the method of coreference resolution and adds role vectors to solve the problem that the excessive number of participants in the class may lead to confusion about the referential logic. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the topic and section of the sentence to capture structural information. We test the HVCMM model on the Chinese class minutes dataset (CCM) and the augmented multiparty interaction (AMI) dataset, and the results show that the HVCMM model outperforms other baseline models on the ROUGE metric. With the help of the HVCMM model, teachers can improve the efficiency of reflection after class and improve the teaching level. Students can review the key content to strengthen their understanding of what they have learned with the help of the class minutes automatically generated by the model.;"[Zhang, Hao; Liu, Sanya; Li, Yaopeng; Ren, Wang; Tong, Hang; Cao, Jiaheng; Zhou, Qiankun] Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Lab Educ Big Data, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China";Central China Normal University;"Zhang, H; Liu, SY (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Lab Educ Big Data, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.";"zhanghao@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; lsy5918@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; liyaopeng@mails.ccnu.edu.cn; 513426363@qq.com; tonghang@mails.ccnu.edu.cn; 1377174469@qq.com; zqk2431730802@mails.ccnu.edu.cn";;"Zhang, Hao/0000-0002-6819-7968; Liu, Sannyuya/0000-0002-4926-3720";"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62077024]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1401303]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China)";This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62077024 and in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1401303.;;44;0;0;3;16;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2162-237X;2162-2388;;IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR;IEEE Trans.

Consolidation coefficients of the derived equation decrease with increasing retardation time parameters of the Kelvin model. The regression module of the educational program shows a negative power of fit with an MSE of (0.134), and a 1:1 scatter plot between the derived equation and the 1D-consolidation equation, indicating a complete fit between both equations. The derived negative power fit equation of the educational program has led to a new expression of the stress ratio of the dashpot unit of the Kevin model. The altered Kelvin dashpot stress ratio is verified experimentally using a resistance-capacitance (RC) circuit connected to the microcontroller and linked with the educational program. The RC circuit, Arduino-Uno, and the LabVIEW educational program are useful tools in teaching the rheology of soil mechanics inside the classroom.

With the introduction of 5G, it is becoming more necessary for 4G LTE users to find ways of maximizing the technology while they await the installation and implementation of the new 5G networks. A comprehensive analysis of the quality of 4G LTE MBB services in three different locations in Lagos is performed. Minimal optimization techniques using particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to propose solutions to the identified problems. A methodology that involves data collection, statistical analysis, and optimization techniques is adopted to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) for MBB services in the three locations: UNILAG, Ikorodu, and Oniru VI. The measured KPIs include reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and signal-to-noise ratio (SINR). Specific statistical analysis was performed, and the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis were calculated for the measured KPIs. Additionally, the probability distribution functions for each KPI were plotted to infer the quality of MBB services in each location. Subsequently, the PSO algorithm was used to optimize the KPIs in each location, and the results were compared with the measured data to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization. Generally, the optimization process results in an improvement in the quality of service (QoS) in the investigated environments. Findings also indicated that a single KPI, such as RSRP, is insufficient for assessing the quality of MBB services as perceived by end-users. Therefore, multiple KPIs should be considered instead, including RSRQ and RSSI. In order to improve MBB performance in Lagos, recommendations require mapping and replanning of network routes and hardware design. Additionally, it is clear that there is a significant difference in user experience between locations with good and poor reception and that consistency in signal values does not necessarily indicate a good user experience. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights and solutions for improving the quality of MBB services in Lagos and can help service providers better understand the needs and expectations of their end users.;"[Imoize, Agbotiname Lucky] Univ Lagos, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Akoka 100213, Lagos, Nigeria; [Udeji, Friday] Ambrose Alli Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Ekpoma 310103, Nigeria; [Isabona, Joseph] Fed Univ Lokokja, Dept Phys, Lokaja 260101, Nigeria; [Lee, Cheng-Chi] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Res & Dev Ctr Phys Educ Hlth & Informat Technol, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, New Taipei City 24206, Taiwan; [Lee, Cheng-Chi] Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41354, Taiwan";"University of Lagos; Fu Jen Catholic University; Asia University Taiwan";"Lee, CC (corresponding author), Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Res & Dev Ctr Phys Educ Hlth & Informat Technol, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, New Taipei City 24206, Taiwan.;Lee, CC (corresponding author), Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41354, Taiwan.";"aimoize@unilag.edu.ng; udejiomofriday@gmail.com; joseph.isabona@fulokoja.edu.ng; cclee@mail.fju.edu.tw";"Lee, Cheng-Chi/AGH-0724-2022; Imoize, Agbotiname Lucky/AAL-8305-2020";"Lee, Cheng-Chi/0000-0002-8918-1703; Imoize, Agbotiname Lucky/0000-0001-8921-8353; Isabona, Joseph/0000-0002-2606-4315";"Nigerian Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) through the Nigerian-German Postgraduate Program [57473408]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through the Nigerian-German Postgraduate Program [57473408]";"Nigerian Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) through the Nigerian-German Postgraduate Program; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through the Nigerian-German Postgraduate Program(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))";The work of Agbotiname Lucky Imoize is supported by the Nigerian Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) through the Nigerian-German Postgraduate Program under grant 57473408.;;51;1;1;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1999-5903;;;FUTURE INTERNET;Future Internet;MAY 12;2023;15;5;;;;;;;181;10.3390/fi15050181;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi15050181;;;35;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;H8BB0;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000998139800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the deployment of these technologies has also prompted investigation into the potentially unanticipated consequences of their introduction, to both positive and negative ends. This paper chooses to focus specifically on the relationship between gender bias and AI, exploring claims of the neutrality of such technologies and how its understanding of bias could influence policy and outcomes. Building on a rich seam of literature from both technological and sociological fields, this article constructs an original framework through which to analyse both the perpetuation and mitigation of gender biases, choosing to categorize AI technologies based on whether their input is text or images. Through the close analysis and pairing of four case studies, the paper thus unites two often disparate approaches to the investigation of bias in technology, revealing the large and varied potential for AI to echo and even amplify existing human bias, while acknowledging the important role AI itself can play in reducing or reversing these effects. The conclusion calls for further collaboration between scholars from the worlds of technology, gender studies and public policy in fully exploring algorithmic accountability as well as in accurately and transparently exploring the potential consequences of the introduction of AI technologies.;"[O'Connor, Sinead; Liu, Helen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Taipei, Taiwan";National Taiwan University;Liu, H (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.;helenliu4@ntu.edu.tw;Liu, Helen Kang-huey/A-4148-2010;Liu, Helen Kang-huey/0000-0003-1968-2171;National Science Council [MOST110CD804-1];National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);National Science Council, MOST110CD804-1, Helen K.

P.";;Citrien 2 Project Leaders;Upscaling telemonitoring in Dutch University Medical Centres: A baseline measurement;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Telemonitoring; Normalisation Process Theory; Implementation; Baseline";"RESPONSE RATE; TRENDS";Introduction and objective: The Dutch university medical centres (UMC's) are on the forefront when it comes to validation, implementation and research of telemonitoring. To aid the UMC's in their effort, the Dutch Gov-ernment has supported the UMC's by fostering the 'Citrien eHealth program'. This program aims at nationwide implementation and upscaling of telemonitoring via a collaborative network. To quantify the success of this program, this study aims to provide insights into the current adoption of telemonitoring by health care pro-fessionals (HCP) within Dutch UMC's. Methods: Based on the evaluation framework as adapted from the Normalization Process Theory (NPT) a cross-sectional study was conducted in all Dutch UMC's. Thirty healthcare professionals (HCPs) per UMC were invited to complete the 23-item Normalization MeAsure Development (NoMAD) questionnaire, a tool to assess the de-gree of normalisation of telemonitoring. Results: The over-all response rate was 52.4% (124/240). Over 80% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they understand how telemonitoring affects the nature of their work, with a mean score of 1.49 (N = 117, SD 0.74). HCPs reported to believe telemonitoring will become a normal part of their work in the near future (N = 124, mean = 8.67, SD = 1.38). Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the difference between current practise and future use of telemonitoring predicts to be statistically significant (Z = -7.505, p <= 0.001). Mean scores for appropriate training and sufficient resources are relatively low (2.39 and 2.70 respectively), indicating a barrier for collective action. Conclusion: This is the first study to assess the implementation of telemonitoring as standard practise across Dutch UMCs. The HCPs in this study are the frontrunners, believing that telemonitoring will become standard practise in the future despite the fact that it is currently not. Based on the results of this study, both educational and implementation strategies including practical skills training are highly recommended in order to scale up tele-monitoring widely.;"[Gijsbers, H.

Applications such as movie recommendations, document recommendations, and so forth are using machine learning algorithms to suggest user-tailored content. These algorithms train on historical user query data and predict documents based on user preferences. The existing methodologies on personalization have shown two main limitations: privacy concerns over the usage of personal data and a lack of efficient personalizing strategies for better accuracy and overall standardization. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) algorithm for personalized search results using temporal characteristics of the user query data. Individual user query data is used for developing specific client models while the aggregate of such models is developed for general search suggestions. The introduction of time-series interpretation of queries provides for larger training data as well as a better understanding of a user's current needs and intent. The proposed algorithm is validated using the AOL4PS dataset and is evaluated on the efficiency of personalization, and the amount of data and time required to achieve the results. Its performance is compared with existing state-of-the-art personalization algorithms that utilize deep learning and FL. Mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is the primary metric for measuring the algorithm's performance. After training for 35 federated rounds, the server model yielded an MRR score of 0.8638 while the client models were able to yield an average MRR score of 0.9308.;"[Sarkar, Sagnik; Agrawal, Shaashwat; Chowdhuri, Aditi; Ramani, S.] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India";"Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT); VIT Vellore";Chowdhuri, A (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.;aditinirapada.2018@vitalum.ac.in;Chowdhuri, Aditi/ABB-2939-2021;"Chowdhuri, Aditi/0000-0003-0734-3535; Agrawal, Shaashwat/0000-0002-0006-267X";;;;;27;0;0;1;17;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4720;1468-0394;;EXPERT SYST;Expert Syst.;2023 APR 24;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1111/exsy.13318;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/exsy.13318;;APR 2023;12;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;E3PM5;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000974695600001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Costa, JM;;;;Costa, Joana M.;;;Using game concepts to improve programming learning: A multi-level meta-analysis;COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"game concepts; gamification; multilevel meta-analysis; programming learning";"GAMIFICATION; MOTIVATION; MODEL";Gamification has been widely used in education due to its application to different contexts. The vast number of possibilities allows the creation of learning strategies that lead to students' success. Despite the high acceptance of gamification among several authors in educational contexts, there are many dispersed studies with high differences in their results. Although gamification impacts motivation, interest, and engagement, its effect on students' learning outcomes needs to be clarified. This study aims to investigate the effects of gamification on programming learning and the impact of the most used game concepts on knowledge acquisition. A multi-level meta-analysis was conducted on studies above K-12 to understand the effects of gamification in programming learning. From 15 combined effect sizes, it was analyzed the effect of points, badges, levels, avatars, leaderboards, and the number of elements used. The results showed that gamification leads to a significant increase in the results (Cohen's d = 0.4) but essentially due to the use of levels (p < .05). Using badges, points, avatars, and leaderboards showed no significant effect on programming learning, suggesting that these elements may be more beneficial to motivating or engaging the students. Gamification can be efficient in programming learning, but it is recommended the use of levels.;[Costa, Joana M.] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, ISTAR, Lisbon, Portugal;Instituto Universitario de Lisboa;Costa, JM (corresponding author), Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, ISTAR, Lisbon, Portugal.;joana.martinho.costa@iscte-iul.pt;Costa, Joana Martinho/N-5757-2019;Costa, Joana Martinho/0000-0001-7400-0132;Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UIDB/04466/2020, UIDP/04466/2020];Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT));Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Numbers: UIDB/04466/2020, UIDP/04466/2020;;59;1;1;10;36;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

As the main method of human emotional expression, facial expression contains much information about inner emotional changes. In recent years, with the wide application of artificial intelligence in education, related research on student sentiment analysis has become a hot topic in the educational technology field. Analysing affective data is helpful for understanding students' learning status and provides an important basis for the effective implementation of learning interventions, which is of great significance for the evaluation of teaching effects and changes in teaching methods. However, traditional learner emotion recognition methods have some problems, such as low recognition rates, complex algorithms, poor robustness, and easy loss of the key information of facial expression features. Therefore, this article proposes a learner emotion recognition method based on NAGNet. The network model is composed of Res2Net, nonlocal attention and GeM pooling, which can fuse global expression feature information to realize fine-grained sentiment analysis. Additionally, we conducted training and experiments on the large-scale learner emotion dataset FERPlus. The NAGNet model trained by the public emotion dataset FERPlus has a recognition accuracy of 89.3% for eight kinds of student emotions. The experimental results show that the method can quickly and accurately identify learner emotional states. We conduct experiments in a real classroom scenario, and use the NAGNet model proposed in this article to analyse and detect students' real-time sentiment. Then teachers improve teaching methods by understanding the feedback of students' classroom status. Therefore, this method has important reference significance in the construction of wisdom classrooms and wisdom learning environments.;"[Zhu, Huihui; Hu, Pengyun; Tang, Xianpiao; Xia, Daoxun] Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Big Data & Comp Sci, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Xia, Daoxun] Guizhou Normal Univ, Engn Lab Appl Technol Big Data Educ Guizhou, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Huang, Haifeng] CETC Big Data Res Inst Co Ltd, Natl Engn Res Ctr Big Data Applicat Improvement Go, Guiyang, Peoples R China";"Guizhou Normal University; Guizhou Normal University";Xia, DX (corresponding author), Guizhou Normal Univ, Engn Lab Appl Technol Big Data Educ Guizhou, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China.;dxxia@gznu.edu.cn;Zhu, Huihui/C-4948-2018;;"Central Government Guides Local Science and Technology Development Special Project [QKZYD[2022]4054]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62166008]; Guiyang Science and Technology Talent Training Project [ZKHT[2023]48-9]";"Central Government Guides Local Science and Technology Development Special Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guiyang Science and Technology Talent Training Project";"Central Government Guides Local Science and Technology Development Special Project, Grant/Award Number: QKZYD[2022]4054; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 62166008; Guiyang Science and Technology Talent Training Project, Grant/Award Number: ZKHT[2023]48-9";;35;2;2;15;49;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1532-0626;1532-0634;;CONCURR COMP-PRACT E;Concurr.

J;Carmi, G;;;;Carmi, Golan;;;Students' attitude and learning effectivenes for two types of podcasts in MBA course;ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Podcast; Attitudes; Learning effectiveness; e-Learning; Prior experience";"TEACH MATHEMATICS; VIDEO PODCASTS; TECHNOLOGY; LECTURES; IMPACT";Purpose - The purpose of this research is to inspect the perceptions of MBA students regarding learning through podcasts. The author's goals are to reveal the students' attitudes toward the use of podcasts as a key learning tool in a graduate academic course, to examine the learning efficacy in this mode of learning, to inspect students' opinions regarding flexibility in learning with podcasts and to examine whether there is a different reference to podcasts as a mid-term assignment vs podcasts as a substitute for lectures. Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines the learning attitudes and effectiveness of postgraduate students in business administration toward combining podcasts as an e-Learning tool. This paper also explores the flexibility of this kind of asynchronous learning. Two types of podcasts for two different pedagogical purposes were examined in the study, one as a team mid-term assignment and second as recorded lectures. The main results of this study provide significant evidence that previous experience in listening to podcasts on the Internet has a significant impact on learning effectiveness, student attitudes and learning satisfaction while using this technology. In fact, this study establishes that students that are technologically oriented and have prior experience listening to podcasts learn more in the course, have positive attitudes toward podcast technology as a learning tool, have high learning effectiveness and are satisfied with the flexibility of the asynchronous learning process. Findings - The findings state that both in the mid-term assignment and in the course lessons as students listened to podcasts more frequently and gained experience listening to podcasts on the Internet, the students expressed more positive views toward learning using this technology, the students' learning effectiveness was higher and the students were more satisfied with the flexibility made possible by using this asynchronous technology tool of e-Learning. Moreover, the results of the study clearly indicate a positive correlation between listening to the podcast lessons in the course and the effectiveness of learning both in the mid-term assignment and in classes. Research limitations/implications - This study has some limitations. First, the findings are limited by the relatively small sample, with graduate students in an MBA program, in a course from the field of technological entrepreneurship. Furthermore, in this study, the students had partial freedom to choose the podcast for the students' mid-term assignment from a specific well-known program in the field of entrepreneurship and were not free to choose podcasts from any site available on the Internet. Although this process guided the students to use podcasts from a quality podcast program, the process also reduced the students' choice to some extent. Practical implications - Academic institutions must provide the appropriate technological infrastructure for the development, creation and recording of quality podcasts by lecturers for students, in addition to training lecturers to teach through podcasts as an integral part of e-Learning advanced tools. Furthermore, institutions must financially incentivize and educationally encourage lecturers to teach at least some of the content in the course using pre-prepared podcasts. Social implications - The author's first suggestion to lecturers that wish to use podcasts as learning resources is to familiarize themselves with the technology and resources available to introduce students to the basics of podcasting and to make the students aware of the podcast's benefits. Second, the study highly recommends to integrate podcasts into the teaching curriculum in academia as early as possible in the basic courses, before the students move on to advanced courses in undergraduate studies. In this way, students in advanced courses can make better use of this technology. Originality/value - As far as the author knows, this is the first study that combined two types of podcasts used for two complementary pedagogical purposes in an academic course: the first, open and available online podcasts as part of a mid-term assignment and the second type of podcasts that are recorded audio lessons as a complete replacement for course lectures. Additionally, the study sharpens the understanding that students' previous experience with technology is of great importance to learning effectiveness, as well as positive opinions and high learning satisfaction.;[Carmi, Golan] Jerusalem Coll Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Jerusalem, Israel;;Carmi, G (corresponding author), Jerusalem Coll Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Jerusalem, Israel.;carmi@jct.ac.il;;;;;;;62;1;1;4;11;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;Leeds;floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1468-4527;1468-4535;;ONLINE INFORM REV;Online Inf.

In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1-9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4-6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers' knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students' skill and ambition level.;"[Mannila, Linda] Linkoping Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Leinonen, Teemu] Aalto Univ, Dept Media, Media Lab, POB 11000, FI-00076 Aalto, Finland; [Bauters, Merja] Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Narva rd 25, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia; [Veermans, Marjaana] Univ Turku, Dept Teacher Educ, FI-20014 Turun, Finland";"Linkoping University; Aalto University; Tallinn University; University of Turku";Mannila, L (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.;linda.mannila@liu.se;"Bauters, Merja Lina/AAE-4352-2022; Leinonen, Teemu/G-2331-2013; Bauters, Merja/KZU-2354-2024";"Leinonen, Teemu/0000-0002-6227-052X; Bauters, Merja/0000-0001-8501-5751; Mannila, Linda/0000-0001-6020-2737";;;;;112;3;3;4;8;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2666-5573;;;COMPUT EDUC OPEN;Computer Educ.

M-learning is becoming increasingly common in higher education institutions all around the world. The use of mobile devices for education and learning has also gained popularity in Jordan. Unlike studies about Jordan, there are many studies that thoroughly analyze the situation of m-learning in other countries. Thus, it is important to understand the current situation of m-learning at Jordanian universities, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there have been some studies conducted prior to COVID-19 and a few studies after COVID-19, there is a need for a comprehensive study that provides an in-depth exploration of the current situation, student adoption, benefits, disadvantages, and challenges, particularly following COVID-19. Therefore, this study utilizes a sequential exploratory mixed research method to investigate the current state of the art of m-learning in Jordanian higher education with a particular focus on student adoption, benefits, disadvantages, and challenges. Firstly, the study explores the existing literature on m-learning and conducts 15 interviews with educators and learners in three Jordanian universities to gain insights into their experiences with m-learning. The study then distributes a survey to students at four Jordanian universities, representing both public and private universities, to generalize the results from the qualitative study. Additionally, the study investigates the relationship between student enrollment in public/private universities and the adoption of m-learning. The study came to the conclusion that students have a positive opinion of m-learning and are also willing to use it. However, there are a number of disadvantages and challenges to its adoption. Additionally, there is a relationship between student enrolment in public/private universities and the adoption of m-learning. These findings have important implications for institutions that want to incorporate m-learning into their undergraduate and graduate degree programs, as they aid decision-makers in these universities in creating frameworks that may be able to meet the needs of m-learning.;"[Al-Qora'n, Lamis F.] Philadelphia Univ, Dept Software Engn, Amman 19392, Jordan; [Al-odat, Abdelsalam M.] Philadelphia Univ, Dept Dev Studies, Amman 19392, Jordan; [Al-jaghoub, Saheer] Univ Petra, Dept Ebusiness & Commerce, Amman 961343, Jordan; [Al-Yaseen, Hussein] Al Ahliyya Amman Univ, Dept Business Technol, Amman 19328, Jordan";"Philadelphia University Jordan; Philadelphia University Jordan; Petra University; Al-Ahliyya Amman University";Al-Qora'n, LF (corresponding author), Philadelphia Univ, Dept Software Engn, Amman 19392, Jordan.;lalqoran@philadelphia.edu.jo;Alqoran, Lamis Farah/HOF-6392-2023;"Al-qora'n, Lamis F./0000-0003-4670-2318; Alodat, Abdelsalam M./0009-0002-6875-9729";Philadelphia University;Philadelphia University;This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Philadelphia University.

With AI decision making, face-to-face interactions are minimized, and decisions are part of a more opaque process that humans do not always understand. Within decision-making research, the concept of moral distance is used to explain why individuals behave unethically towards those who are not seen. Moral distance abstracts those who are impacted by the decision and leads to less ethical decisions. The goal of this paper is to identify and analyze the moral distance created by AI through both proximity distance (in space, time, and culture) and bureaucratic distance (derived from hierarchy, complex processes, and principlism). We then propose the ethics of care as a moral framework to analyze the moral implications of AI. The ethics of care brings to the forefront circumstances and context, interdependence, and vulnerability in analyzing algorithmic decision making.;"[Villegas-Galaviz, Carolina] Univ Notre Dame, Technol Eth Ctr, 204 OShaughnessy Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Martin, Kirsten] Univ Notre Dame, IT Analyt & Operat, South Bend, IN USA";"University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame";Villegas-Galaviz, C (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Technol Eth Ctr, 204 OShaughnessy Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;"cvillega@nd.edu; kmarti33@nd.edu";;villegas-galaviz, carolina/0000-0001-9200-0347;;;;;64;4;4;14;31;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0951-5666;1435-5655;;AI SOC;AI Soc.;2023 MAR 23;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-023-01642-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01642-z;;MAR 2023;12;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;A4AG7;37358944;hybrid, Green Published;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000954566100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This data needs to be explored in depth to better understand various facets of student learning behavior. The educational data mining approach has given provisions to extract useful and non-trivial knowledge from large collections of student data. Using the educational data mining method of classification, this research analyzes data of 291 university students in an attempt to predict student performance at the end of a 4-year degree program. A student segmentation framework has also been proposed to identify students at various levels of academic performance. Coupled with the prediction model, the proposed segmentation framework provides a useful mechanism for devising pedagogical policies to increase the quality of education by mitigating academic failure and encouraging higher performance. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the applicability of classifying students into multiple performance levels using a small subset of courses being taught in the initial two years of the 4-year degree program.;"[Meghji, Areej Fatemah; Mahoto, Naeem Ahmed] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol Jamshoro, Dept Software Engn, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Pakistan; [Asiri, Yousef; Alshahrani, Hani; Sulaiman, Adel] Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Najran, Saudi Arabia; [Shaikh, Asadullah] Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Dept Informat Syst, Najran, Saudi Arabia";"Najran University; Najran University";Asiri, Y (corresponding author), Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Najran, Saudi Arabia.;yasiri@nu.edu.sa;"Shaikh, Asadullah/S-4815-2016; Meghji, Areej Fatemah/KFQ-5483-2024; Alshahrani, Hani Mohammed/GQQ-1607-2022";"Shaikh, Asadullah/0000-0003-4806-6159; Meghji, Areej Fatemah/0000-0002-7302-2767; Alshahrani, Hani Mohammed/0000-0002-8799-9448";"Deanship of Scientific Research at Najran University under the Research Groups Funding program at Najran University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [NU/RG/SERC/12/23]; Research Groups Funding program at Najran University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia";"Deanship of Scientific Research at Najran University under the Research Groups Funding program at Najran University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Research Groups Funding program at Najran University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia";The authors received funding from the Deanship of Scientific Research at Najran University for this research through a grant (NU/RG/SERC/12/23) under the Research Groups Funding program at Najran University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The detection of misconceptions is very difficult and takes a long time as a human being. Our aim in the study carried out is to determine the misconceptions of the students regarding the concept of the atom by machine instead of humans. This study proposes two novel methods: the Transformers model and the fastText algorithm, to classify the students' answers. Since there is currently no Turkish language model for physics-related questions or the physics domain, we trained a transformer model from scratch for this domain using transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. In the second part of this research, we proposed an unsupervised learning approach to accurately understand and identify the reasons behind the misconceptions. For this purpose, we utilized sentence transformers to obtain vector representation of the sentences with transformer-based denoising autoencoder training. We then used two clustering algorithms: an agglomerative one and a density-based one, to group similar sentences in a high-dimensional vector space. Again, for the first time, the unsupervised transformer-based denoising autoencoder training of the sentence transformers was employed for the Turkish language to provide domain adaptation for sentence transformers. Finally, we compared the human performance (experts' opinions) and the proposed method results for both the classification and the clustering tasks according to the kappa metric. According to our results, we managed to distinguish misconceptions with a high accuracy of between 0.97 and 1.00 with our proposed methodology.;"[Demirezen, Mustafa Umut] Huawei Turkey R&D Ctr, Intelligent Applicat DC Dept, Saray Mah Ahmet Tevfik Ileri Cad Onur Ofis Pk Is M, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Yilmaz, Ozgur] Istanbul Univ Cerrahpasa, Hasan Ali Yucel Educ Fac, Dept Comp Educ & Instructional Technol, Istanbul, Turkiye; [Ince, Elif] Istanbul Univ Cerrahpasa, Hasan Ali Yucel Educ Fac, Dept Sci Educ, Istanbul, Turkiye";"Huawei Technologies; Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa; Istanbul University - Cerrahpasa";Yilmaz, O (corresponding author), Istanbul Univ Cerrahpasa, Hasan Ali Yucel Educ Fac, Dept Comp Educ & Instructional Technol, Istanbul, Turkiye.;oyilmaz@iuc.edu.tr;"Demirezen, Mustafa Umut/N-5761-2019; Yilmaz, Ozgur/D-4760-2019; Ince, Elif/R-1127-2018";"Demirezen, Mustafa Umut/0000-0002-9045-4238; Yilmaz, Ozgur/0000-0002-1122-4558; Ince, Elif/0000-0003-4821-5441";;;;;82;1;1;3;11;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0941-0643;1433-3058;;NEURAL COMPUT APPL;Neural Comput.

Managing demands of complexity and speed is leading to growing reliance by education systems on disembodied artificial intelligence (dAI) programs, which, ironically, are inherently incapable of interpreting students' embodied interactions. This is fueling a potential crisis of complexity. Augmented intelligence systems offer promising avenues for managing this crisis by integrating the strengths of omnipresent dAI to detect complex patterns of student behavior from multimodal datastreams, with the strengths of humans to meaningfully interpret embodied interactions in service of consequential decision making to achieve a balance between complexity, interpretability, and accountability for allocating education resources to children.;[Nathan, Mitchell J.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin Ctr Educ Res, Sch Educ, Educ Psychol Dept,MAGIC Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA;"University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison";Nathan, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Wisconsin Ctr Educ Res, Sch Educ, Educ Psychol Dept,MAGIC Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;mnathan@wisc.edu;;;;;;;60;1;1;10;25;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2624-8212;;FRONT ARTIF INTELL;Front.

Learners generate a lot of information on learning platforms every day, and most of the information is recorded in logs. However, it is difficult to start to extract valuable information from the huge and messy log data of learning platforms, which requires a methodology to guide and a lot of time and cost to process the data. Therefore, this research proposes a data analysis process, using the GQM (Goal Question Metric) method as a guide for the analysis process combined with the Banerjee analysis model to build a series of question lists and metrics to evaluate students' learning behavior performance, and using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana) as an analysis environment to solve the problem of data processing.

As with most applica-tions, Web applications can acquire software flaws (known as bugs), whose symptoms are seen during the development stage and, even worse, in production. The use of debuggers is beneficial for detecting bugs. Unfortunately, most JavaScript debuggers (1) only support the step into/throughfeature in an execution program to detect a bug, and (2) do not allow developers to go back-in-time at the application execution to take actions to detect the bug accurately. For example, the second limitation does not allow developers to modify the value of a variable to fix a bug while the application is running or test if the same bug is triggered with other values of that variable. Using concepts such as continuations and static analysis, this article presents a usable debugger for JavaScript, named DeloreanJS, which enables developers to go back-in-time in different execution points and resume the execution of a Web application to improve the understanding of a bug, or even experiment with hypothetical scenarios around the bug. Using an online and available version, we illustrate the benefits of DeloreanJS through five examples of bugs in JavaScript. Although DeloreanJS is developed for JavaScript, a dynamic prototype-based object model with side effects (mutable variables), we discuss our proposal with the state-of-art/practice of debuggers in terms of features. For example, modern browsers like Mozilla Firefox include a debugger in their distribution that only support for the breakpoint feature. However DeloreanJS uses a graphical user interface that considers back-in-time features. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the usability of DeloreanJS and Mozilla Firefox's debugger using the system usability scale approach. We requested 30 undergraduate students from two computer science programs to solve five tasks. Among the findings, we highlight two results. First, we found that 100% (15) of participants recommended DeloreanJS, and only 53% (eight) recommended Firefox's debugger to complete the tasks. Second, whereas the average score for DeloreanJS is 71.6 (Good), the average score for Firefox's debugger is 55.8 (Acceptable).;"[Leger, Paul; Ruiz, Felipe] Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ingn, Coquimbo, Elqui, Chile; [Fukuda, Hiroaki] Shibaura Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Cardozo, Nicolas] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia";"Universidad Catolica del Norte; Shibaura Institute of Technology; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)";Leger, P (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Norte, Escuela Ingn, Coquimbo, Elqui, Chile.;pleger@gmail.com;Leger, Paul/Q-6174-2017;Leger, Paul/0000-0003-0969-5139;;;;;72;1;1;1;3;PEERJ INC;LONDON;341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND;;2376-5992;;PEERJ COMPUT SCI;PeerJ Comput.

In order for the instructor to understand how the student interacts with the various activities in the classroom, it is essential to predict their participation. The current work aims to identify the best algorithm for predicting student engagement in the classroom. In this paper, we gathered data from VLE and prepared them using a variety of data preprocessing techniques, including the elimination of missing values, normalization, encoding, and identification of outliers. On our data, we ran a number of machine learning (ML) classification algorithms, and we assessed each one using cross-validation methods and many helpful indicators. The performance of the model is evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores. The results show that the CATBoost model is having higher accuracy than the rest. This proposed model outperformed in all the aspects compared to previous research. The results part of this paper indicates that the CATBoost model had an accuracy of approximately 92.23%, a precision of 94.40%, a recall of 100%, and an AUC score of 0.9624.

With constant development and rise in deep learning, computer vision technology has undergone an impactful transformation. In the era before deep learning, there existed algorithms and technologies for scene text detection, but the perfor-mance was mediocre. In recent years, deep learning technology has remarkably transformed scene text detection. Researchers have witnessed notable advancements in the approach, methodology, and overall performance of the newly discovered techniques. In this paper, the predominant focus is on summarizing and analysing the significant progress in scene text detection through deep learning. This paper covers an introduction to scene text detection, steps to perform scene text recognition and detection, technique before deep-learning, recent techniques and their insights, some results, and an overview by comparing the algorithms. We will also emphasize the criteria that make a search algorithm a good choice for performing scene text detection and recognition, the notable differences incorporated by deep learning, and analyse the drawbacks of the techniques used before deep learning.

In this study, we presented a design-based research program that aims to design and examine an inno-vative application, Infrared Explorer, that organically integrates physical experiments with a virtual environment. Relying on the theory of concreteness fading, we use infrared imaging and multimodal analytics to augment students' interaction with physical materials. Through two it-erations of design and testing, we analyzed a variety of data sources and found that students actively used the application during their physical experimentation process. This technological application can allow students to highlight salient information and remove confusing details such that students' conceptual understanding of thermal concepts can develop further. Through this iterative development process, we also synthesized factors (e.g., multitasking and cognitive load) to consider when designing and implementing technologies to blend physical and virtual envi-ronments supporting learning.

In order to improve the video detection effect, the video fidelity and compression rate, a remote video detection algorithm for sports wrong actions under wireless network is proposed. By extracting key frames in video clips, a real-time video transmission model is established based on wireless network, which transmits key frame extraction results real time with the support of real-time transmission protocol and forward error correction mechanism. The deterministic constrained nonlinear optimization method is used to estimate joint and overall motion parameters. Based on each parameter, the aggregated channel feature method is used to identify the target in the video sequence, and the support vector machine is used as a classifier of sports actions to recognize wrong actions. Then, the multi-scale space of moving images is constructed, the multi-layer box filter is used to simulate Gaussian convolution, and the simulation results are corresponded to the target areas in the remote video of sports wrong actions, thereby realizing the remote video detection of sports wrong actions. The experimental results show that the fidelity rate of the proposed algorithm is always above 90.3%, the compression rate is more than 80%, and only one key point is omitted. This proves that the video fidelity rate and compression rate of this method are high, and the detected key points are the same as the actual key points, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.;"[Liu, Hao] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Phys Educ Dept, Wuhan 430064, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ting] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China";"Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University";Yang, T (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Hohhot 010011, Peoples R China.;"liuhao@zuel.edu.cn; yangting@imau.edu.cn";;;;;;;23;4;4;2;5;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1022-0038;1572-8196;;WIREL NETW;Wirel.

There is plenty to be said about their positive effects. On the other hand, however, some serious negative implications of social media have been repeatedly highlighted in recent years, pointing at various threats to society and its more vulnerable members, such as teenagers, in particular, ranging from much-discussed problems such as digital addiction and polarization to manipulative influences of algorithms and further to more teenager-specific issues (e.g., body stereotyping). The impact of social media-both at an individual and societal level-is characterized by the complex interplay between the users' interactions and the intelligent components of the platform. Thus, users' understanding of social media mechanisms plays a determinant role. We thus propose a theoretical framework based on an adaptive Social Media Virtual Companion for educating and supporting an entire community, teenage students, to interact in social media environments in order to achieve desirable conditions, defined in terms of a community-specific and participatory designed measure of Collective Well-Being (CWB). This Companion combines automatic processing with expert intervention and guidance. The virtual Companion will be powered by a Recommender System (CWB-RS) that will optimize a CWB metric instead of engagement or platform profit, which currently largely drives recommender systems thereby disregarding any societal collateral effect. CWB-RS will optimize CWB both in the short term by balancing the level of social media threats the users are exposed to, and in the long term by adopting an Intelligent Tutor System role and enabling adaptive and personalized sequencing of playful learning activities. We put an emphasis on experts and educators in the educationally managed social media community of the Companion. They play five key roles: (a) use the Companion in classroom-based educational activities; (b) guide the definition of the CWB; (c) provide a hierarchical structure of learning strategies, objectives and activities that will support and contain the adaptive sequencing algorithms of the CWB-RS based on hierarchical reinforcement learning; (d) act as moderators of direct conflicts between the members of the community; and, finally, (e) monitor and address ethical and educational issues that are beyond the intelligent agent's competence and control. This framework offers a possible approach to understanding how to design social media systems and embedded educational interventions that favor a more healthy and positive society. Preliminary results on the performance of the Companion's components and studies of the educational and psychological underlying principles are presented.";"[Ognibene, Dimitri; Lomonaco, Francesco; Bursic, Sathya] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Psychol, Milan, Italy; [Ognibene, Dimitri] Univ Essex, Fac Sci & Hlth, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester, England; [Wilkens, Rodrigo] Univ Catholique Louvain UCLouvain, Inst Langage & Commun IL&C, Cental, Ottignies louvain La Neuv, Belgium; [Taibi, Davide; Scifo, Lidia] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Educ Technol, Palermo, Italy; [Hernandez-Leo, Davinia; Theophilou, Emily; Lobo, Rene Alejandro; Sanchez-Reina, J.

Students performance is very crucial in tackling issues of learning process and one of the important matters to measure learning outcomes. The ability to use data knowledge to improve education systems has led to the development of the field of research known as educational data mining (EDM). EDM is the creation of techniques to investigate data gathered from educational settings, allowing for a more thorough and accurate understanding of students and the improvement of educational outcomes for them. The use of machine learning (ML) technology has increased significantly in recent years. Researchers and teachers can use the measurements of success, failure, dropout, and more provided by the discipline of data mining in education to predict and simulate education processes. Therefore, this work presents an analysis of students performance using data mining methods. The paper presents both clustering and classification techniques to identify the impact of students performance at early stage with on the GPA. For the clustering technique, the paper uses dimensionality reduction mechanism by T-SNE algorithm with various factors at early stage such as admission scores and first level courses, academic achievement tests (AAT) and general aptitude tests (GAT) in order to explore the relationship between these factors and GPA's. For the classification technique, the paper presents experiments on different machine learning models on predicting student performance at early stages using different features including courses' grades and admission tests' scores. We use different assessment metrics to evaluate the quality of the models. The results suggest that educational systems can mitigate the risks of students failures at the early stages.;"[Alhazmi, Essa; Sheneamer, Abdullah] Jazan Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia";Jazan University;Sheneamer, A (corresponding author), Jazan Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia.;asheneamer@jazanu.edu.sa;;;Jazan University [W41-055];Jazan University;This work was supported by Jazan University under Grant W41-055.;;28;3;3;15;20;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;27579;27589;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3250702;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3250702;;;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";D0DY1;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000965530900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Having the capacity to talk about wellbeing issues with others is an important wellbeing literacy (WL) skill. This paper addresses the need for a better understanding of wellbeing literacy (WL) skills in remote WIL workplaces. Interpreting WL in remote settings can further the definition of WL by extending it to a digital context. In contributing to Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research and the emerging field of WL, this paper explores how WIL students develop WL skills in a remote setting, which we define as Digital Wellbeing Literacy (DWL). In-depth interviews were held with WIL academics, WIL professionals, WIL students and wellbeing experts on digital and pedagogical factors that support WL in remote work. We found that students proactively use digital communication tools and social media to communicate wellbeing concerns, which in turn helps them practice DWL.

We thoroughly evaluate the BukaGini algorithm against traditional Gini index-based methods on various real-world datasets. These datasets include the High School Students' Performance (HSSP) dataset, which examines factors affecting student performance; Cancer Data, which focuses on identifying cancer types based on gene expression; Spambase, which targets spam email classification; and the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which addresses network intrusion detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the BukaGini algorithm consistently outperforms traditional Gini index-based methods in terms of accuracy. Across the tested datasets, the BukaGini algorithm achieves improvements ranging from 0.32% to 2.50%, underscoring its effectiveness in handling diverse data types and problem domains.

In this field, providing users with accurate and understandable predictions is challenging, but equally important. The goals of this study are multifaceted: to identify students at-risk; to identify differences in assessment across different environments; methods for assessing students; and to determine the relationship between teacher employment status and student achievement. This study performs an empirical comparison of the performance and efficiency of ensemble classification methods based on bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting for successful predictions. An ensemble model is developed and validated using double, triple, and quadruple combinations of classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, J48 decision trees, Adaboost, logistics, and multilayer perceptron. This study uses primary quantitative data from the learning management system of a university in Pakistan to analyze the performance of these models.

Within student groups, common characteristics can reveal trends in overall student learning. Most studies tend to focus on the common characteristics of students but ignore their individual characteristics. However, individual characteristics are important in promoting student academic performance because they allow us to understand the unique learning performances of each student. To address this issue, this paper proposes a student performance prediction approach. First, addressing the problem of difficulty in effectively dividing the student samples under multi-dimensional discrete data, we propose a method that combines the relationship matrix-based bipartite network approach (RMBN) with Louvain clustering. Second, the hybrid neural network model based on a relationship matrix (RMHNN) is proposed to address the problem that discrete types of features are difficult to fit by algorithms. The results show that the implementation of the model on real student data can effectively predict student performance with an accuracy of 93.1% and an F1-score of 90.45%. With the model's predicted student performance, educators can provide individualized support and assistance to each student.;"[Chen, Ziling; Cen, Gang; Wei, Ying; Li, Zifei] Zhejiang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Informat & Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China";Zhejiang University of Science & Technology;Cen, G (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Informat & Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China.;gcen@163.com;;, Gang Cen/0009-0002-0719-6862;Zhejiang University of Science and Technology Teaching Research and Reform Key Projects;Zhejiang University of Science and Technology Teaching Research and Reform Key Projects;No Statement Available;;45;0;0;7;18;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;131260;131272;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3335985;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3335985;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";AT8S0;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001120803800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the various sectors contributing to these emissions, the education sector, particularly at the university level, plays a crucial role in generating carbon footprints. While several studies have examined carbon footprints within universities, few have focused on understanding the behavior and activities of individuals. Statistics show that students are the primary contributors to carbon emissions in higher education. Despite the availability of various methods for calculating carbon emissions, limited studies have utilized such data to predict future trends. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a predictive analytics model that leveraged students' learning activities as a significant factor to predict future trends in university carbon emissions. Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) was used as a case study, especially computer science-related majors. The carbon emission calculation utilized a formula that incorporated various emission sources, including electricity, transportation, and paper consumption. In the 2022/2023 academic year, ITB generated 612.8 tons of CO $_{2}\text{e}$ . The prediction modeling employed the SVR algorithm and utilized historical data, such as carbon emissions from the last 30 days, and external information, such as weather, event-related data, and university data. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics, yielding values of 129.41 for MAE, 158.03 for RMSE, 0.98 for R2, and 15.83 for MAPE. The results provided insights for universities to assess their carbon footprint and raised awareness among the academic community, supporting decision-making to optimize carbon emissions at the students' level.;"[Hans, Michael; Hikmawati, Erna; Surendro, Kridanto] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Bandung, Indonesia";Institute Technology of Bandung;Hans, M (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Bandung, Indonesia.;23522011@std.stei.itb.ac.id;Hikmawati, Erna/JZE-2839-2024;Hikmawati, Erna/0000-0002-6162-5341;Institut Teknologi Bandung;Institut Teknologi Bandung;The authors would like to thank to Institut Teknologi Bandung for supporting this research.;;31;2;2;5;7;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;114976;114991;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3324725;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3324725;;;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";X1FM1;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001095974200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

International students, particularly, turned to Twitter to express their struggles and hardships during this difficult time. To better understand the sentiments and experiences of these international students, we developed the Situational Aspect-Based Annotation and Classification (SABAC) text mining framework. This framework uses a three-layer approach, combining baseline Deep Learning (DL) models with Machine Learning (ML) models as meta-classifiers to accurately predict the sentiments and aspects expressed in tweets from our collected Student-COVID-19 dataset. Using the pro-posed aspect2class annotation algorithm, we labeled bulk unlabeled tweets according to their contained aspect terms. However, we also recognized the challenges of reducing data's high dimensionality and sparsity to improve performance and annotation on unlabeled datasets. To address this issue, we proposed the Volatile Stopwords Filtering (VSF) technique to reduce sparsity and enhance classifier performance. The resulting Student-COVID Twitter dataset achieved a sophisticated accuracy of 93.21% when using the random forest as a meta-classifier. Through testing on three benchmark datasets, we found that the SABAC ensemble framework performed exceptionally well. Our findings showed that international students during the pandemic faced various issues, including stress, uncertainty, health concerns, financial stress, and difficulties with online classes and returning to school. By analyzing and summarizing these annotated tweets, decision-makers can better understand and address the real-time problems international students face during the ongoing pandemic.;"[Hussain, Shabir; Yu, Yang; Wahid, Junaid Abdul; Weiyan, Hou] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Ayoub, Muhammad] Cent South Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Khan, Akmal] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Data Sci, Bahawalpur, Pakistan; [Moller, Dietmar P.

More recently, IRT has been applied to evaluate machine learning algorithm performance on a single classification dataset, where the student is now an algorithm, and the test question is an observation to be classified by the algorithm. In this paper we present a modified IRT-based framework for evaluating a portfolio of algorithms across a repository of datasets, while simultaneously eliciting a richer suite of characteristics - such as algorithm consistency and anomalousness - that describe important aspects of algorithm performance. These characteristics arise from a novel inversion and reinterpretation of the traditional IRT model without requiring additional dataset feature computations. We test this framework on algorithm portfolios for a wide range of applications, demonstrating the broad applicability of this method as an insightful algorithm evaluation tool. Furthermore, the explainable nature of IRT parameters yield an increased understanding of algorithm portfolios.;"[Kandanaarachchi, Sevvandi] CSIROs Data61, Res Way, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Smith-Miles, Kate] Univ Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia";"Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Melbourne";Kandanaarachchi, S (corresponding author), CSIROs Data61, Res Way, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia.;"SEVVANDI.KANDANAARACHCHI@DATA61.CSIRO.AU; SMITH-MILES@UNIMELB.EDU.AU";Kandanaarachchi, Sevvandi/ACI-0827-2022;;"Australian Research Council [FL140100012]; ARC Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications (OPTIMA) [IC200100009]";"Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); ARC Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications (OPTIMA)";Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council through the Australian Laureate Fellowship FL140100012, and the ARC Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications (OPTIMA) under grant IC200100009.

Recommendation systems are essential applications of cognitive computing in educational scenarios. They help learners personalize their learning better by computing student and exercise characteristics using data generated from relevant learning progress. The paper introduces a Learning and Forgetting Convolutional Knowledge Tracking Exercise Recommendation model (LFCKT-ER). First, the model computes students' ability to understand each knowledge concept, and the learning progress of each knowledge concept, and the model consider their forgetting behavior during learning progress. Then, students' learning stage preferences are combined with filtering the exercises that meet their learning progress and preferences. Then students' ability is used to evaluate whether their expectations of the difficulty of the exercises are reasonable. Then, the model filters the exercises that best match students' expectations again by students' expectations. Finally, we use a simulated annealing optimization algorithm to assemble a set of exercises with the highest diversity. From the experimental results, the LFCKT-ER model can better meet students' personalized learning needs and is more accurate than other exercise recommendation systems under various metrics on real online education public datasets.";"[Li, Mengjuan; Niu, Lei] Cent China Normal Univ, Fac Artificial Intelligence Educ, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China";Central China Normal University;Niu, L (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Fac Artificial Intelligence Educ, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;lniu@ccnu.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62006090]; Research Funds of Central China Normal University (CCNU) [31101222211, 31101222212]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Funds of Central China Normal University (CCNU)";Funding Statement: This research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62006090) , and Research Funds of Central China Normal University (CCNU) under Grants 31101222211 and 31101222212.;;36;0;0;8;8;TECH SCIENCE PRESS;HENDERSON;871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA;1546-2218;1546-2226;;CMC-COMPUT MATER CON;CMC-Comput.

Quality education relies on the teachers' qualifications, knowledge, and experience over the years. However, the demand for technical and knowledge-based education is increasing with the world's demands. Therefore, assessing the knowledge of teaching professionals to meet external demand becomes mandatory. This article introduces an Acceded Data Evaluation Method (ADEM) using Fuzzy Logic (FL) for teaching quality assessment. The proposed method inputs the teachers' skills and students' productivity for evaluation. The teachers' knowledge and updated skills through training and self-learning are the key features for evaluating the independents' performance. The impact of the above features on the student qualifying ratio and understandability (through examination) are analyzed periodically. Depending on the qualifications and performance, the teachers' knowledge update is recommended with the new training programs. In this evaluation process, fuzzy logic is implied for balancing and identifying the maximum validation criteria that satisfy the quality requirements. The recommendations using partial and fulfilled quality constraints are identified using the logical truth over the varying assessments. The proposed method is analyzed using the metrics evaluation rate, quality detection, recommendations, evaluation time, and data balancing.;"[Liu, Lin] Jiamusi Univ, Jiamusi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lijun] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Zhongshan Inst, Zhongshan 528400, Peoples R China";"Jiamusi University; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China";Yang, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Zhongshan Inst, Zhongshan 528400, Peoples R China.;yanglijun@zsc.edu.cn;;;"key project of education and teaching reform research of Jiamusi University, Research and Practice on the Training Mode of Normal Professionals in Local Comprehensive Universities under the Background of Professional Certification [2020JY1-05]; National Science of Education 13th Five-Year Plan Project Titled A Study of the Relationship between Teachers' Professional Ability Composition and Students' Learning Quality in Applied Technology Colleges and Universities [DIA170357]";"key project of education and teaching reform research of Jiamusi University, Research and Practice on the Training Mode of Normal Professionals in Local Comprehensive Universities under the Background of Professional Certification; National Science of Education 13th Five-Year Plan Project Titled A Study of the Relationship between Teachers' Professional Ability Composition and Students' Learning Quality in Applied Technology Colleges and Universities";This research was supported by the key project of education and teaching reform research of Jiamusi University, Research and Practice on the Training Mode of Normal Professionals in Local Comprehensive Universities under the Background of Professional Certification, project number is 2020JY1-05 and the 2017 National Science of Education 13th Five-Year Plan Project Titled A Study of the Relationship between Teachers' Professional Ability Composition and Students' Learning Quality in Applied Technology Colleges and Universities (the Key lssues of Ministry of Education, project number is DIA170357).;;37;0;0;3;6;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1064-1246;1875-8967;;J INTELL FUZZY SYST;J.

This is further exacerbated by the fact that student dropout rates in engineering are higher than in other disciplines. Understanding engineering students' performance patterns and potential influences can lead to developing interventions to improve engineering students' success. Recent advances in data science and educational data mining have made it possible to extract valuable information from historical data, which can supplement interventions. This study sought to extract insights and information from real-world data, analyse correlations in the dataset's variables and better understand the influences of student performance. Exploratory data analysis was applied to the dataset to visualise the dataset and infer the correlations between variables provided in the dataset on student performance patterns. We used Python for data analysis and visualising the correlation between variables. The results show gender disparity in engineering enrollments, with only a quarter of female students enrolled. The study also indicates that the completion rates could be much higher. Another finding is that most students who drop out do so because of choosing the wrong qualifications. Furthermore, when comparing the percentages, female students performed slightly better than their male counterparts. The correlation analysis shows no relationships between gender, race, admission point score, mathematics marks and science marks with student performance in engineering. Understanding student performance patterns can reduce dropout rates by correctly advising students to enrol on the most suitable programmes, and aid support interventions are needed to improve student success in engineering.;"[Maphosa, Mfowabo; Paul, Babu S.] Univ Johannesburg, Inst Intelligent Syst, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Doorsamy, Wesley] Univ Leeds, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Leeds LS2 9JT, England";"University of Johannesburg; University of Leeds";Maphosa, M (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Inst Intelligent Syst, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.;mfowabo@gmail.com;;"Maphosa, Mfowabo/0000-0003-3702-6821; Doorsamy, Wesley/0000-0001-9043-9882";;;;;51;1;1;0;5;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;48977;48987;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277225;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3277225;;;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";I9FR6;;Green Submitted, gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001005770800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance of students can be supported by the extra assignments and projects given by the instructors for students with low performance. However, a major problem is that students at-risk cannot be identified early. This situation is being investigated by various researchers using Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning is used in a variety of areas and has also begun to be used to identify students at-risk early and to provide support by instructors. This research paper discusses the performance results found using Machine learning algorithms to identify at-risk students and minimize student failure. The main purpose of this project is to create a hybrid model using the ensemble stacking method and to predict at-risk students using this model. We used machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost Classifier and Logistic Regression in this project. The performance of each machine learning algorithm presented in the project was measured with various metrics. Thus, the hybrid model by combining algorithms that give the best prediction results is presented in this study. The data set containing the demographic and academic information of the students was used to train and test the model. In addition, a web application developed for the effective use of the hybrid model and for obtaining prediction results is presented in the report. In the proposed method, it has been realized that stratified k-fold cross validation and hyperparameter optimization techniques increased the performance of the models. The hybrid ensemble model was tested with a combination of two different datasets to understand the importance of the data features.

Academic success, socioemotional development, and the general well-being of adolescents are all significantly affected by family dynamics and practices. Due to the wide range and variety of familial conditions, it cannot be easy to analyze and recognize these patterns. This paper offers an intelligent strategy for effectively identifying and analyzing family education patterns using the random forest (RF) algorithm. We begin by collecting an extensive data set that includes family factors, educational practices, and student outcomes. The raw data is first preprocessed using min-max normalization. Furthermore, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the pertinent attributes from the preprocessed data. The best features are chosen using the reptile search optimization (RSO) algorithm to increase the accuracy of the random forest. Comparing the empirical results to state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the suggested RF technique's higher effectiveness in identifying family education patterns. The value of performance metrics such as accuracy (94.7%), precision (95.2%), recall (95.7%), and F1 score (96.1%).

J;Qin, MY;;;;Qin, Mengyang;;;Application of efficient recognition algorithm based on deep neural network in English teaching scene;CONNECTION SCIENCE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"English text; deep neural network; GCN; attention mechanism";;The recognition of English texts in teaching scenes is a practical research direction. English text recognition can be widely used in English teaching scenes, such as assisting teachers to recognise students' English homework, text positioning before text translation, developing outdoor classrooms, assisting junior students in scene understanding and so on. To identify English information in different scenes as accurately as possible, identifying the corresponding text content is the key. Based on a deep neural network, this paper proposes GCN-Attention English recognition algorithm. The experiment adopts the deep learning framework Tensorflow, which combines 10(4) x 10(4) size GCN with an attention mechanism for training. The output of GCN is used to train the cyclic neural network to continuously predict the next most likely letter in the sequence. The goal of training is to match the output words with the expected words as much as possible. The test results show that the model can have a good recognition accuracy for the scene image data set used in teaching.;[Qin, Mengyang] Henan Vocat Coll Agr, Dept Tourism Management, Zhengzhou 451450, Peoples R China;;Qin, MY (corresponding author), Henan Vocat Coll Agr, Dept Tourism Management, Zhengzhou 451450, Peoples R China.;qinmengyang2328@163.com;;;;;;;32;2;2;2;20;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0954-0091;1360-0494;;CONNECT SCI;Connect.

Deep learning techniques, especially recurrent neural networks, can greatly improve the performance of prediction models. However, deep neural networks usually have low interpretability, which creates obstacles for customers to deeply understand the prediction results and make quick responses. In addition, the existing deep learning prediction methods rely heavily on the centralized training of massive data. However, the transmission of data from the client to the server poses a threat to the data security of customers. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework with federated learning for short-term residential load forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new automatic relevance determination network for feature interpretation, combined with the encoder-decoder architecture to achieve interpretable multi-step load prediction. In the edge computing network, the training scheme based on federated learning does not share the original data, which can effectively protect data privacy. The introduction of iterative federated clustering algorithm can alleviate the problem of non-independent and identical distribution of data in different households. We use two real-world datasets to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. Finally, we discuss in detail the feature interpretation of these two datasets.;"[Xu, Chongchong; Chen, Guo; Li, Chaojie] Cent South Univ, Sch Automat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China";Central South University;Chen, G (corresponding author), Cent South Univ, Sch Automat, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.;guo.chen@csu.edu.cn;"QIU, LI/JPK-7397-2023; Liu, Yilin/JWP-9153-2024; wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; Chaojie, Li/GVR-9434-2022; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023";"Liu, Yilin/0000-0002-7581-3933;";National Natural Science Foundation of China [62073344];National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));This article was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. (62073344).;;43;3;3;2;23;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0941-0643;1433-3058;;NEURAL COMPUT APPL;Neural Comput.

It aims to provide a set of aspect terms and sentiments from a piece of text. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is now an essential tool for analysing pedagogical data. In academic institutions, student feedback is an influential gauge to measure the quality of the teaching-learning process. It helps higher education institutions to reconsider and improve their policies for student recruitment and retention. This paper proposed a situation awareness multi-layer topic modelling and enhanced hybrid machine learning approach for evaluating students' textual feedback data in academic institutions. The proposed Aspect2Labels (A2L) approach is divided our system into three layers. To preserve semantic information, we extracted general aspects terms in the first layer known as high-level aspects. We pulled low-level aspects terms associated with high-level aspect terms in the second layer and the third layer used for sentiment orientation. We used zero-shot learning, LDA, and different variants of LDA for the aspect extraction process. We performed annotation on unlabelled students' comments using our proposed A2L approach, and we obtained 91.3% accuracy in this process. We developed and tested novel algorithms for aspect terms mapping to label each aspect term to corresponding feedback. Different machine learning algorithms have been used to classify sentiments according to extracted aspects.

Automation is the process of linking commercial software to third-parties applications built in EXCEL-Visual Basic for Applications. The capability of automation as a powerful tool for simulating unprecedented complex processes suggests that it could be a relevant background complement to the classical one offered by a university. In this sense, a seminar about automation based on the study of two cases: a refrigeration process and a production one taken from literature, has been proposed at the University of Castilla-La Mancha. The analysis of the survey performed for the subject evaluation resulted to be very positive. Students consider the methodology of the course and the potentiality of automation for developing their research and professional skills appropriately. However, more examples are required to better understand the automation concept and its potential application to other situations. Finally, they declare that the concept of automation requires a lot of expertise and deep knowledge of programming and the correct application of numerical methods for solving complex problems.;"[Valverde, Jose L.

However, there is lack of theoretical underpinnings in developing intervention to allow for positive behavioral change and evaluating them. The evaluation of theory based cybersecurity training warrants the use of program evaluation techniques.Objective: The protection motivation theory (PMT) was employed to understand the behavioral change af-ter the implementation of cybersecurity training. The evaluation was done on three levels of Kirkpatrick's evaluation model - reaction, learning and behavior.Method: A pre-post quasi experimental design was adopted in this research. A total of 154 undergraduate students from computing and digital arts backgrounds took part in the research.Results: The results of the study showed that the PMT based training was effective in increasing the threat knowledge of the students along with the increase in information of countermeasure strategies. From the two components of the PMT, self-efficacy was found to be the significant predictor of the cy-bersecurity behavioral intention in both pre-test and post-test PMT models. The cybersecurity training increased the self-efficacy of the students significantly and contributed towards cybersecurity behavioral intention change. The findings of this study imply that in designing the cybersecurity trainings, educators should dominantly take into account the self-efficacy component of the PMT.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

With the development of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, target detection algorithms based on deep learning have become mainstream, and typical algorithms such as SSD (Single Shot Detection) and YOLO series have emerged. Based on the videos or images collected in the perception layer of the IoT paradigm, deep learning models are used in the processing layer to implement various intelligent applications. However, none of these deep learning-based algorithms are perfect, and there is room for improvement in terms of detection accuracy, computing speed, and multi-target detection capabilities. In this paper, by introducing the concept of cross-stage local network, embedded connection (EC) components are constructed and embedded at the end of the YOLO-v4 network to obtain an improved YOLO-v4 network. Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to quickly and effectively identify the students' actions when they are occluded, the Repulsion loss function is connected in series on the basis of the original YOLO-v4 loss function. The newly added loss function consists of two parts: RepGT loss and RepBox loss. The RepGT loss function is used to calculate the loss values between the target prediction box and the adjacent ground truth boxes to reduce false positive detection results; the RepBox loss function is used to calculate the loss value between the target prediction box and other adjacent target prediction boxes to reduce false negative detection results. The training and testing are carried out on the classroom behavior datasets of teachers and students, respectively. The experimental results show that the average precision of identifying various classroom behaviors of different targets exceeds 90%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. The model performs well in sustainable classroom behavior recognition in educational context, accurate recognition of classroom behaviors can help teachers and students better understand classroom learning and promote the development of intelligent classroom model.";"[Chen, Henghuai] Xiamen Univ Technol, Org Dept Party Comm, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China; [Guan, Jiansheng] Xiamen Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China";"Xiamen University of Technology; Xiamen University of Technology";Guan, JS (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China.;jsguan@xmut.edu.cn;;;Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [2020J02048];Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China;This work was supported by Key Project of Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China, Research on Key Technology of Intelligent Inspection Robot in Power Distribution Room.

Being aware of it helps the student to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and the teacher to provide more valuable personalized interventions. Furthermore, learning style-based adaptive educational systems can be designed, which have been shown to increase student satisfaction or learning gain, while reducing the time needed to learn. It is therefore important to have an accurate method for identifying students' learning styles. Since the traditional approach of filling in dedicated psychological questionnaires has several disadvantages, automatic methods have been proposed, based on investigating student observable behavior in a learning environment. Research done so far generally takes a mono-algorithmic approach to identify learning styles, and the precision rates leave room for improvement. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid multi-step architecture based on ant colony system and artificial neural networks to increase the precision of learning styles identification. Two different variants are proposed and evaluated with data from 75 students; results show high precision values, outperforming existing automatic approaches for learning style identification. The proposed architecture can be integrated into widely used educational systems (e.g., learning management systems) to provide learners and/or teachers with information about students' learning styles. In addition, it can be integrated into adaptive educational systems and plugins of learning management systems to automatically identify learning styles and personalize instruction respectively.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Previous approaches have focused on tackling the lengthy nature of scientific articles, aiming to improve the computational efficiency of summarizing long text using a flat, unstructured abstract. However, the structured format of scientific articles and characteristics of each section have not been fully explored, despite their importance. The lack of a sufficient investigation and discussion of various characteristics for each section and their influence on summarization results has hindered the practical use of automatic summarization for scientific articles. To provide a balanced abstract proportionally emphasizing each section of a scientific article, the community introduced the structured abstract, an abstract with distinct, labeled sections. Using this information, in this study, we aim to understand tasks ranging from data preparation to model evaluation from diverse viewpoints. Specifically, we provide a preprocessed large-scale dataset and propose a summarization method applying the introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRaD) format reflecting the characteristics of each section.

It has therefore become necessary to understand factors that lead to high attrition rates among learners and identify at-risk students for urgent academic counselling. In providing a proactive response to learner attrition, the study deployed a machine learning algorithm with high model accuracy to predict students' drop-out rates and identify dominant attributes that affect learner attrition and retention. An attrition model was built and validated among support vector machine, decision tree, multilayer perceptron, and random forest algorithms. The machine learning algorithms were tested for accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC using the 10-fold and the 5-fold comparative cross-validation techniques. In addition to the cross-validation technique, the chi-square feature selection mechanism was implemented to understand the algorithms' training time and accuracy. The random forest emerged as the best-performing algorithm, with an accuracy of 70.98% and 69.74% for the 10-fold and the 5-fold cross-validation implementations, respectively.;"[Dake, Delali Kwasi; Buabeng-Andoh, Charles] Univ Educ, Dept ICT Educ, PO 25, Winneba, Ghana";;Dake, DK (corresponding author), Univ Educ, Dept ICT Educ, PO 25, Winneba, Ghana.;"dkdake@uew.edu.gh; cbandoh@uew.edu.gh";;Dake, Delali Kwasi/0000-0002-6067-6980;;;;;40;3;4;1;2;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

This study also explores students' conceptual understanding of the unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm of K-means after being exposed to this method. The learning of DS methods and techniques has become paramount for the new generations of undergraduate engineering students. However, little is known about effective strategies to support student learning of DS and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The research questions are: How do students conceptualize their understanding of an unsupervised ML method after engaging with interactive visualizations designed using the computational cognitive apprenticeship approach? How do the affordances of the interactive visualizations support or hinder student knowledge integration of an unsupervised machine learning method? Design-based research allowed for the iterative design, implementation, and validation of the pedagogy in the context of a working classroom. For this, data collection methods often take the form of student artifacts. We performed a qualitative content analysis of students' written responses and reflections elicited during the learning process. Results suggest that the computational cognitive apprenticeship promoted knowledge integration. After interacting with the computational notebooks, most students had accurate conceptions of the goal and the nature of the method and identified factors affecting the output of the algorithm. Students found it useful to have a concrete representation of the method, which supported its conceptual understanding and showcased the acquisition of strategic knowledge for its appropriate execution.

Our goal was to review and explore the elements of network structures that can be used to understand the complexity of the whole ERASMUS student mobility network at the institutional level. The results suggest some socioeconomic and individual behavioral factors underpinning the emergence of the network. While the nodes are spatially distributed, geographical distance does not play a role in the network's structure, although parallel travelling strategies exist, i.e., in terms of preference of short- and long-distance. The European regions of home and host countries also affect the network. One of the most considerable driving forces of edge formation between institutions are the subject areas represented by participating institutions. The study finds that faculties of institutions are connected rather than institutions, and multilayer network model suggested to explore the mechanisms of those connections. The results indicate that the information uncovered by the study is helpful to scholars and policymakers.;"[Gadar, Laszlo; Kosztyan, Zsolt T.; Telcs, Andras] Eotvos Lorand Res Network ELKH, MTA PE Budapest Ranking Res Grp, Veszprem, Hungary; [Kosztyan, Zsolt T.; Telcs, Andras] Univ Pannonia, Dept Quantitat Methods, Veszprem, Hungary; [Telcs, Andras] Wigner Res Ctr Phys, Budapest, Hungary; [Abonyi, Janos] Univ Pannonia, ELKH PE Complex Syst Monitoring Res Grp, Veszprem, Hungary; [Gadar, Laszlo] Univ Pannonia, Veszprem, Hungary; [Telcs, Andras] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Theory, Budapest, Hungary";"Hungarian Research Network; Office for Supported Research Groups (ELKH); University of Pannonia; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics; University of Pannonia; Hungarian Research Network; Office for Supported Research Groups (ELKH); University of Pannonia; Budapest University of Technology & Economics";"Gadár, L (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Res Network ELKH, MTA PE Budapest Ranking Res Grp, Veszprem, Hungary.;Gadár, L (corresponding author), Univ Pannonia, Veszprem, Hungary.";laszlo@gadar.hu;"András, Telcs/B-7756-2008; Kosztyán, Zsolt T/B-5048-2012";;"MTA-PE Budapest Ranking Research Group [16208]; Thematic Excellence Program 2020-National Challenges sub-program [2020-4.1.1-TKP2020]; Research Centre at the Faculty of Business and Economics [PE-GTK-GSKK A095000000-1]";"MTA-PE Budapest Ranking Research Group; Thematic Excellence Program 2020-National Challenges sub-program; Research Centre at the Faculty of Business and Economics";"MTA-PE Budapest Ranking Research Group (Grant No. 16208); 2020-4.1.1-TKP2020 Thematic Excellence Program 2020-National Challenges sub-program; Research Centre at the Faculty of Business and Economics No. PE-GTK-GSKK A095000000-1.";;87;0;0;0;3;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2364-8228;;APPL NETW SCI;Appl.

Visual tracking algorithms which follow the objects manipulated by the camera wearer can provide useful information to effectively model such interactions. In the last years, the computer vision community has significantly improved the performance of tracking algorithms for a large variety of target objects and scenarios. Despite a few previous attempts to exploit trackers in the FPV domain, a methodical analysis of the performance of state-of-the-art trackers is still missing. This research gap raises the question of whether current solutions can be used off-the-shelf or more domain-specific investigations should be carried out. This paper aims to provide answers to such questions. We present the first systematic investigation of single object tracking in FPV. Our study extensively analyses the performance of 42 algorithms including generic object trackers and baseline FPV-specific trackers. The analysis is carried out by focusing on different aspects of the FPV setting, introducing new performance measures, and in relation to FPV-specific tasks. The study is made possible through the introduction of TREK-150, a novel benchmark dataset composed of 150 densely annotated video sequences. Our results show that object tracking in FPV poses new challenges to current visual trackers. We highlight the factors causing such behavior and point out possible research directions. Despite their difficulties, we prove that trackers bring benefits to FPV downstream tasks requiring short-term object tracking. We expect that generic object tracking will gain popularity in FPV as new and FPV-specific methodologies are investigated.;"[Dunnhofer, Matteo; Micheloni, Christian] Univ Udine, Machine Learning & Percept Lab, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Furnari, Antonino; Farinella, Giovanni Maria] Univ Catania, Image Proc Lab, Viale A Doria 6, I-95125 Catania, Italy";"University of Udine; University of Catania";Dunnhofer, M (corresponding author), Univ Udine, Machine Learning & Percept Lab, Via Sci 206, I-33100 Udine, Italy.;"matteo.dunnhofer@uniud.it; furnari@dmi.unict.it; gfarinella@dmi.unict.it; christian.micheloni@uniud.it";"Micheloni, Christian/E-5427-2012; FARINELLA, Giovanni Maria/L-8555-2015";"Dunnhofer, Matteo/0000-0002-1672-667X; Micheloni, Christian/0000-0003-4503-7483; FARINELLA, Giovanni Maria/0000-0002-6034-0432; FURNARI, Antonino/0000-0001-6911-0302";Universita degli Studi di Udine within the CRUI-CARE Agreement;Universita degli Studi di Udine within the CRUI-CARE Agreement;Open access funding provided by Universita degli Studi di Udine within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.;;117;12;13;4;17;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0920-5691;1573-1405;;INT J COMPUT VISION;Int.

Construed as a complex task, surprisingly little is known about the actual act of conceptual modeling, and about modeling difficulties learners experience. Combining complementary modes of observation of learners' modeling processes, we study modeling difficulties encountered while performing a data modeling task. Using the concept of cognitive breakdown, we analyze audiovisual protocols of the individual modelers' modeling processes, recordings of their interactions with the employed modeling software tool and survey data of modelers about their perception of encountered modeling difficulties. In an exploratory study and a follow-up study, we identify eight types of modeling difficulties related to modeling entity types, generalization hierarchies, relationship types, attributes and cardinalities. The identified types of modeling difficulties contribute to a better and more complete understanding of data modeling processes intended to inform design science research on modeling assistance for data modelers at different stages of their learning and mastering of conceptual data modeling.;"[Rosenthal, Kristina; Strecker, Stefan] Univ Hagen, Hagen, Germany; [Snoeck, Monique] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium";"Fern University Hagen; KU Leuven";Rosenthal, K (corresponding author), Univ Hagen, Hagen, Germany.;"kristina.rosenthal@fernuni-hagen.de; stefan.strecker@fernuni-hagen.de; monique.snoeck@kuleuven.be";"Rosenthal, Kristina/KIG-2723-2024; Snoeck, Monique/H-7771-2018";"Rosenthal, Kristina/0000-0002-7698-2130; Snoeck, Monique/0000-0002-3824-3214; Strecker, Stefan/0000-0002-0533-6326";Projekt DEAL;Projekt DEAL;Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.;;83;2;2;1;4;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1619-1366;1619-1374;;SOFTW SYST MODEL;Softw.

Multivariate data analytics relies heavily on linear algebra, optimization, and statistics and can be challenging for students to understand given that most curricula do not have strong coverage in the latter three topics. This article describes interactive software - the Latent Variable Demonstrator (LAVADE) - for teaching, learning, and understanding latent variable methods. In this software, users can interactively compare latent variable methods such as Partial Least Squares (PLS), and Principal Component Regression (PCR) with other regression methods such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (lasso), Ridge Regression (RR), and Elastic Net (EN). LAVADE helps to build intuition on choosing appropriate methods, hyperparameter tuning, and model coefficient interpretation, fostering a conceptual understanding of the algorithms' differences. The software contains a data generation method and three chemical process datasets, allowing for comparing results of datasets with different levels of complexity.

J;"Zhao, ER; He, J; Jin, Z; Wang, Y";;;;"Zhao, Erxi; He, Jian; Jin, Zhou; Wang, Yue";;;Student-Centered Learning Environment Based on Multimedia Big Data Analysis;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;The application of current information technology in education, especially multimedia network technology, has brought about major changes in the content and methods of instruction. It has replaced the conventional teacher-centered, textbook-centered, and classroom-centered teaching environment with a student-centered, information technology-based learning environment that includes a rich network of multimedia learning resources and virtual reality. Through the interaction between students and students and between students and the learning environment, students can acquire knowledge on the basis of observation, understanding, and cognition, so as to grasp the essence of things. It is an effective cognitive tool for students to explore freely and visualize various knowledge and skills. Therefore, the teacher is no longer the authority of knowledge imparting, but the learner's guide and helper or even the senior partner in the learner's learning activities. This shift will allow teaching staff to focus more on the design and development of learning environments and resources. This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm CURE, which overcomes the shortcomings of the detection rate and stability of the classical clustering algorithm and is suitable for solving the clustering problem in the learning environment of big data analysis. Experiments are carried out on some international standard network security dataset KDDCUP101, and the running time of the algorithm is 1230 s. The results show that the stability of the proposed algorithm is increased by 30.22% and the detection rate is increased by 10.98% compared with the common algorithm. Compared with the global K-means algorithm, the time complexity is also greatly enhanced.;"[Zhao, Erxi; Jin, Zhou] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Nucl Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Jian] North China Elect Power Univ, Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yue] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Energy Power & Mech Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China";"North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University";Zhao, ER (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Nucl Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"51201648@ncepu.edu.cn; unwlmuw0@163.com; c4w5rpmk@163.com; oedga6r2@163.com";;;;;;;20;0;0;1;8;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

For students who fail to adjust to university life smoothly, their status may worsen if the university cannot offer timely and proper guidance. Helping students adapt to university life is a long-term goal for any academic institution. Therefore, understanding the nature of the maladaptation phenomenon and the early prediction of at-risk students are crucial tasks that urgently need to be tackled effectively. This article aims to analyze the relevant factors that affect the maladaptation phenomenon and predict this phenomenon in advance. We develop a prediction framework (MAladaptive STudEnt pRediction, MASTER) for the early prediction of students with maladaptation. First, our framework uses the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm to solve the data label imbalance issue. Moreover, a novel ensemble algorithm, priority forest, is proposed for outputting ranks instead of binary results, which enables us to perform proactive interventions in a prioritized manner where limited education resources are available. Experimental results on real-world education datasets demonstrate that the MASTER framework outperforms other state-of-art methods.;"[Guo, Teng; Zhen, Shihao; Abid, Shagufta] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Software, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Bai, Xiaomei] Anshan Normal Univ, Comp Ctr, Anshan, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Xia, Feng] Federat Univ Australia, Inst Innovat Sci & Sustainabil, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia";"Dalian University of Technology; Anshan Normal University; Federation University Australia";Xia, F (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Inst Innovat Sci & Sustainabil, Ballarat, Vic 3353, Australia.;f.xia@ieee.org;Xia, Feng/Y-2859-2019;Xia, Feng/0000-0002-8324-1859;;;;;89;0;0;5;40;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2330-1635;2330-1643;;J ASSOC INF SCI TECH;;JAN;2023;74;1;;;;;17;32;;10.1002/asi.24718;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.24718;;OCT 2022;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science";7I3XA;;hybrid, Green Published;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000863828100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In light of current studies, there are significant associations between the personalities of software engineers and their work preferences. However, limited studies are using psychometric measurements in software engineering. Objective: We aim to evaluate attitudes of early-stage software engineers and investigate link between their personalities and work preferences. Method: We collected extensive psychometric data from 303 graduate-level students in Computer Science programs at four Pakistani and one Swedish university using Five-Factor Model. The statistical analysis investigated associations between various personality traits and work preferences. Results: The data support the existence of two clusters of software engineers, one of which is more highly rated across the board. Numerous correlations exist between personality qualities and the preferred types of employment for software developers. For instance, those who exhibit greater levels of emotional stability, agreeableness, extroversion, and conscientiousness like working on technical activities on a set timetable. Similar relationships between personalities and occupational choices are also evident in the earlier studies. More neuroticism is reported in female respondents than in male respondents. Higher intelligence was demonstrated by those who worked on the entire development process and technical components of the project. Conclusion: When assigning project tasks to software engineers, managers might use the statistically significant relationships that emerged from the analysis of personality attributes. It would be beneficial to construct effective teams by taking personality factors like extraversion and agreeableness into consideration. The study techniques and analytical tools we use may identify subtle relationships and reflect distinctions across various groups and populations, making them valuable resources for both future academic research and industrial practice.;"[Ahmad, Muhammad Ovais] Karlstad Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Karlstad, Sweden; [Ahmad, Iftikhar] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Qayum, Fawad] Univ Malakand, Dept Comp Sci & IT, Chakdara, Pakistan";"Karlstad University; University of Engineering & Technology Peshawar; University of Malakand";Ahmad, I (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol, Peshawar, Pakistan.;ia@uetpeshawar.edu.pk;"Ahmad, Iftikhar/ABE-5182-2021; Ahmad, Muhamamd Ovais/F-7679-2012";"Ahmad, Iftikhar/0000-0001-7863-3746; Ahmad, Muhamamd Ovais/0000-0002-7885-0369";;;;;57;1;1;1;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2047-7473;2047-7481;;J SOFTW-EVOL PROC;J.

Rehabilitation relies heavily on the repetition of specific movements, and game scenarios are ideal environments to build routines of repetitive exercises that have entertaining characteristics. In this respect, the gamification of the rehabilitation program, through the introduction of game-specific techniques and design concepts, has gained attention as a complementary or alternative to routine rehabilitation programs. A gamified rehabilitation program promises to gain the patient's attention, to reduce the monotony of the process and preserve motivation to attend, and to create virtual incentives through the game, toward maintaining compliance to the prescribed program. This is often achieved through goal-oriented tasks and real-time feedback in the form of points and other in-game rewards. This paper describes MILORD rehabilitation platform, an affordable technological solution, which aims to support health professionals and enable remote rehabilitation, while maintaining health service characteristics and monitoring. MILORD is an end-to-end platform that consists of an interactive computer game, utilizing a leap motion sensor, a centralized user management system, an analysis platform that processes the data generated by the game, and an analysis dashboard presenting a set of meaningful features that describe upper limb movement. Our solution facilitates the monitoring of the patients' progress and provides an alternative way to analyze hand movement. The system was tested with normal subjects and patients and experts to record user's experience, receive feedback, identify any problems, and understand the system's value in monitoring and support motion defect and progress.

Autonomous Vehicles have become a highly popular research topic in recent years because of their significant capability to reduce road accidents and human injuries. This paper is an attempt to survey all recent AI based techniques used to deal with major functions in AVs, namely scene understanding, motion planning, decision making, vehicle control, social behavior, and communication. Our survey focuses solely on deep learning and reinforcement learning based approaches; it does not include conventional (shallow) shallow based techniques, a subject that has been extensively investigated in the past. Our survey builds a taxonomy of DL and RL algorithms that have been used so far to bring solutions to the four main issues in autonomous driving.

The study was primarily conducted using action research and supplemented with data obtained through participant observation and content analysis. The participants were fifth-grade students in an elementary school in Taiwan, and the study was conducted over two semesters. Experts assessed the effectiveness of the pilot program over two semesters and revised the curriculum for formal program implementation in the following two semesters. The efficacy of teaching and learning was evaluated using diverse data collected through student self-evaluation charts, checklists for basic modeling exercises (using software), evaluation charts, and daily teacher logs. The findings revealed that computer-aided drawing is a powerful tool that can help students understand concepts, offer them the opportunity to showcase their creativity, and spark their motivation to learn. The design-oriented model course improved learning performance in basic drawing and design through advanced product design by cultivating the students' creative potential and enhancing their design and creation skills.;"[Huang, Chiung-Yi] Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Ind Technol Educ, 2F,78 1,Huanghai St, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wang, Jen Chun] Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Ind Technol Educ, 62,Shenjhong Rd, Kaohsiung 82446, Taiwan";"National Kaohsiung Normal University; National Kaohsiung Normal University";Wang, JC (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Normal Univ, Dept Ind Technol Educ, 62,Shenjhong Rd, Kaohsiung 82446, Taiwan.;"joy0906@gmail.com; jcwang@nknu.edu.tw";;Wang, Jen Chun/0000-0002-6148-9183;Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 109-2511-H-017-005, MOST 110-2221-E-017-002-MY3];Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);The work done for this study was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under project No. MOST 109-2511-H-017-005 and MOST 110-2221-E-017-002-MY3.;;109;6;6;4;4;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Related works have been recognized by the NeurIPS Test-of-Time award in 2017 and the ICML Best Paper Finalist in 2019. The body of work on random features has grown rapidly, and hence it is desirable to have a comprehensive overview on this topic explaining the connections among various algorithms and theoretical results. In this survey, we systematically review the work on random features from the past ten years. First, the motivations, characteristics and contributions of representative random features based algorithms are summarized according to their sampling schemes, learning procedures, variance reduction properties and how they exploit training data. Second, we review theoretical results that center around the following key question: how many random features are needed to ensure a high approximation quality or no loss in the empirical/expected risks of the learned estimator. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of popular random features based algorithms on several large-scale benchmark datasets and discuss their approximation quality and prediction performance for classification. Last, we discuss the relationship between random features and modern over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), including the use of high dimensional random features in the analysis of DNNs as well as the gaps between current theoretical and empirical results. This survey may serve as a gentle introduction to this topic, and as a users' guide for practitioners interested in applying the representative algorithms and understanding theoretical results under various technical assumptions. We hope that this survey will facilitate discussion on the open problems in this topic, and more importantly, shed light on future research directions.

This assumption, however, has not been experimentally tested against other modes of engagement such as worked example-based reflection. While theory suggests that example-based reflection could be better for conceptual learning, the concern is that the lack of practice will leave students unable to implement the learned concepts in practice, thus leaving them unprepared for work. In this article, therefore, we experimentally contrast programming practice with example-based reflection to observe their differential impact on conceptual learning and performance on a hands-on task in the context of a collaborative programming project. The industry paradigm of Mob Programming, adapted for use in an online and instructional context, is used to structure the collaboration. Keeping with the prevailing view held in pedagogy, we hypothesize that example-based reflection will lead to better conceptual learning but will be detrimental to hands-on task performance. Results support that reflection leads to conceptual learning. Additionally, however, reflection does not pose an impediment to hands-on task performance. We discuss possible explanations for this effect, thus providing an improved understanding of prior theory in this new computer science education context. We also discuss implications for the pedagogy of software engineering education, in light of this new evidence, that impacts student learning as well as work performance in the future.;"[Sankaranarayanan, Sreecharan; Murray, R.

As of today, there is a stream of research that addresses digitalization in education in light of the pandemic. Previous studies show that the challenges with the sudden intensification of digitalization have been particularly challenging in practical and aesthetic subjects. The research question is as follows: What challenges did vocational teachers experience during the emergency remote teaching caused by Covid-19 and what emergent tactics can be identified in vocational teaching practice? Design/methodology/approach The empirical data consists of (1) interviews with two vocational teachers and, (2) workshops with 25 teacher students from different vocational programmes that addressed vocational teaching during the Covid-19 crisis. Findings Emergency remote teaching meant challenges due to the changed socio-material environment that cannot easily be transformed to a vocational teaching setting. The challenges were related to authentic situations and material, problem solving and dexterity. Tactics that emerged as a response to the challenges were mainly connected to attempts to mimic vocational practices. Originality/value Contributions include explaining specific challenges and possibilities in developing vocational competence when teaching is digitalised. Furthermore, it increases the understanding of the relationship between theory and practice in vocational education.

To improve the employment rate of college students, we should first educate each college student in career planning, so that they can clearly understand their own positioning and future development direction. Career planning can guide students to understand their jobs and analyze their professional fields. Faced with massive employment information, it is also a big problem for college students to search and choose information. In this paper, the personalized recommendation system for entrepreneurship is described, and the basic principles of information recommendation are described. The basic information and personal interest points of college students are represented by feature vectors, which provide a favorable theoretical support for college students' career planning and employment and entrepreneurship information recommendation. An information recommendation model under deep learning is formed. Finally, the performance of the model under the traditional algorithm and the optimized information recommendation model is evaluated, and the satisfaction of users to this system is scored so as to provide a convenient and quick information recommendation system for college students, thus indirectly improving the employment rate of graduates and providing corresponding solutions to the problem of difficult employment.;"[Zhang, Hui] Guangdong Ind Polytech, Inst Off, Guangzhou 510300, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhuonan] Guangdong Ind Polytech, Human Resources Div, Guangzhou 510300, Peoples R China";"Guangdong Industry Polytechnic; Guangdong Industry Polytechnic";Zhang, H (corresponding author), Guangdong Ind Polytech, Inst Off, Guangzhou 510300, Peoples R China.;xb210@gdip.edu.cn;;;;;;;25;0;0;6;44;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1939-0114;1939-0122;;SECUR COMMUN NETW;Secur.

In this paper, an English score prediction method based on the XGBoost algorithm is proposed. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model in English score prediction, the principle of the XGBoost algorithm is firstly analyzed as a basis. The English test scores of a university for 2019-2021 were used as the basic data source, and the output probabilities of the proposed model were used to compare the results under different conditions. The experimental results show that the predicted scores are basically consistent with the actual scores. From a scientific point of view, the ability to predict unknown data with low error suggests that it enables students and teachers to identify the underlying factors that make it difficult for students to answer questions. Understanding these causes is useful for designing high-quality courses and lesson plans.;[Chen, Xiaohua] Zhanjiang Univ Sci & Technol, Zhanjiang 524000, Guangdong, Peoples R China;;Chen, XH (corresponding author), Zhanjiang Univ Sci & Technol, Zhanjiang 524000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;chenxiaohua@zjkju.edu.cn;;;Education and Teaching Reform project of Zhanjiang University of Science and Technology A Research on Stratified College English Teaching Model for Application-oriented College [JG202155];Education and Teaching Reform project of Zhanjiang University of Science and Technology A Research on Stratified College English Teaching Model for Application-oriented College;The work was supported by the 2021 Education and Teaching Reform project of Zhanjiang University of Science and Technology A Research on Stratified College English Teaching Model for Application-oriented College Project number: JG202155.;;34;0;0;6;23;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

Especially in basketball teaching, if students do not have promising sports talents and solid basic basketball skills, it is not easy to acquire more basketball skills in physical education courses. Therefore, teaching through video has become inevitable. However, with the growth of video services, traditional cloud computing methods cannot meet the requirements of low latency tasks such as basketball teaching videos. Hence, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) comes into being. Specifically, by introducing the end-edge-cloud system collaborative architecture, a cache strategy of simulated annealing algorithm for extended short-term memory networks is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed caching strategy can effectively reduce transmission latency, improve the quality of basketball teaching, make it easier for students to get basketball skills, and significantly improve students' basketball skills when the ends used by students move between different MEC servers under the collaborative architecture of the end-edge-cloud system.;"[Qiu, Bin] Cangzhou Med Coll, Cangzhou 061001, Peoples R China; [Cao, Di] Cangzhou Tech Coll, Cangzhou 061001, Peoples R China";Cangzhou Normal University;Cao, D (corresponding author), Cangzhou Tech Coll, Cangzhou 061001, Peoples R China.;caodicangczzy@sina.com;;;;;;;26;2;2;2;6;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1864-5909;1864-5917;;EVOL INTELL;Evol.

Genetic algorithms play an important role in the design of intelligent network teaching systems, so the application of genetic algorithms is of great importance to the development of national education in China. The purpose of the design is to cultivate children's interest and enthusiasm in computer technology from an early age and to form a preliminary understanding of computer technology. In recent years, with the popularity of computers and smart phones, the wave of information technology has accelerated in China. Early childhood IT teaching should be combined with the characteristics of the subject and the special understanding characteristics of the elementary school student group, to help students develop their abilities through technological innovation.

Moving target defense (MTD) is one of the emerging areas that promises to protect against this kind of attack by continuously shifting system parameters and changing the attack surface of protected systems. The emergence of network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) technology allows for the implementation of very sophisticated MTD techniques. Furthermore, the introduction of such solutions as field-programmable gate array (FPGA) programmable acceleration cards makes it possible to take the MTD concept to the next level. Applying hardware acceleration to existing concepts or developing new, dedicated methods will offer more robust, efficient, and secure solutions. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are still no major implementations of MTD schemes inside large-scale networks. This survey aims to understand why, by analyzing research made in the field of MTD to show current pitfalls and possible improvements that need to be addressed in future proposals to make MTD a viable solution to address current cyber-security threats in real-life scenarios.;"[Zmuda, Marek] Intel Corp, PL-80298 Gdansk, Poland; [Rawski, Mariusz] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Elect & Informat Technol, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland";"Intel Corporation; Warsaw University of Technology";Rawski, M (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Elect & Informat Technol, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.;mariusz.rawski@pw.edu.pl;Rawski, Mariusz/H-3801-2012;Rawski, Mariusz/0000-0002-7489-0785;Polish National Centre for Research and Development [CYBERSECIDENT/369234/I/NCBR/2017];Polish National Centre for Research and Development;This work was supported by the Polish National Centre for Research and Development under Project CYBERSECIDENT/369234/I/NCBR/2017.;;148;3;3;1;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;SEP;2022;11;18;;;;;;;2886;10.3390/electronics11182886;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11182886;;;32;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";4V4RA;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000859464500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Reproducibility is of critical importance to the scientific community, not just to verify correctness of results but also to see how easily others can understand and work with the given methods. MemXCT is an approach for image reconstruction in X-ray ptychography, which has a broad range of applications in materials science. MemXCT is not the only X-ray tomography algorithm, though; as opposed to compute-centric algorithms, it is designed to scale better by optimizing for memory bandwidth and memory latency. MemXCT also applies several key optimizations in order to ease memory pressure. In this article, we test the performance and strong scaling of MemXCT on 1 to 256 AMD CPU cores (1-4 nodes) and 1-16 Nvidia V100 GPUs (1-4 nodes). We confirm the impact of MemXCT's optimizations. Still, we find that the performance of some important loops in the MemXCT kernel is much lower on the AMD processors (with AVX2) of our CPU nodes compared to the Intel CPUs (with AVX-512) used in the original article.

Data were acquired using a self-regulated learning scale, a game experience questionnaire, a problem-solving process evaluation instrument based on the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a computer-based survey focused on seven problem-solving scenarios, and four digital games. Our results indicate a positive and significant effect on problem-solving performance among study participants with seven or more years of game play experience, and positive feelings toward game learning as reflected in negatively skewed self-regulated learning scores. We also found that the representation and formulation stage served as a significant performance predictor, the planning and execution and monitoring and reflection stages were significant predictors of dynamic/technical problems, and the exploring and understanding stage was a predictor for static/non-technical problems. Our data indicate significant differences in problem-solving cognitive processes across ranges of contexts and characteristics.

This pattern shows the need to enhance physical and athletic scientific training methods. To make the teacher's role more successful is the usage of computer systems and other computing infrastructure. This article aims to show the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the national association for physical education. The digitalization consequences in the profession can be synthesized into the following elements: an operating system for learning, application essential to finish actions, findings recording, movement monitoring, video processing, efficiency correlation and synchronization, object tracking and duration measurement systems, and exercise assessment. While physical activity and athletics are realistic activities, current instructional technology is not sufficient. An intelligent physical education tracking system (IPETS) is proposed in this research. This study analyses and investigates the methodology for the formative assessment of athletic knowledge in computer evaluation. During the first segment, the evaluation technique for the athletic education program was presented. The second step of the paper is to understand the contents of the mathematical formula of particular activity based on the complete approaches proposed for the theory of assessment.

In particular, we focused on college students' perception of productivity changes, benefits, challenges, and their overall preference for the future of online education. Our initial exploratory analysis showed that in most cases, students were not fully satisfied with the quality of the online education, and the majority of them suffered a plummet in their productivities. Despite the challenges, around 61% believed that they would prefer more frequent participation in online programs in the future (compared to the normal conditions before the pandemic). A structural equation model was developed to identify and assess the factors that contribute to their productivity and future preferences. The results showed that lack of sufficient communication with other students/ instructor as well as lack of required technology infrastructure significantly reduced students' productivity. On the other hand, productivity was positively affected by perceived benefits such as flexibility and better time management. In addition, productivity played a mediating role for a number of socio-economic, demographic, and attitudinal attributes: including gender, income, technology attitudes, and home environment conflicts. Accordingly, females, high income groups, and those with home environment conflicts experienced lower productivity, which indirectly discouraged their preference for future online education. As expected, a latent pro-online education attitude increased both the productivity and the future online-education preference. Last but not the least, Gen-Xers were more likely to adopt online-education in the post pandemic conditions compared to their peers.;"[Asgari, Hamidreza; Titiloye, Ibukun] Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 10555 W Flagler St,EC3725, Miami, FL 33174 USA; [Gupta, Rajesh] Univ Lucknow, Dept Stat, Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Jin, Xia] Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 10555 W Flagler St,EC 3603, Miami, FL 33174 USA";"State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Lucknow University; State University System of Florida; Florida International University";Jin, X (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 10555 W Flagler St,EC 3603, Miami, FL 33174 USA.;xjin1@fiu.edu;Gupta, Rajesh/AEA-9388-2022;"Gupta, Rajesh/0000-0001-7833-0235; Jin, Xia/0000-0002-8660-3528";;;;;65;1;1;1;2;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2730-6852;;COMPUT URBAN SCI;Comput.

What they have learned is not only language skills but also the culture behind the language, because language and culture are integrated and inseparable. The purpose of this paper is to explore the teaching research of the teaching mode of using deep learning in contemporary literature courses in colleges and universities. This paper firstly introduces the distance and open education, which refers to a new type of education that uses modern teaching information technology to organize classroom teaching and deliver teaching content under the guidance of the concept of openness. The biggest difference between distance and open education and traditional education lies in the location and method of teaching. Then, the teaching of deep learning theory is explained, and the optimization algorithm of teaching and learning and the problem of education optimization are expounded. The algorithm successfully simulates the process of teachers passing professional knowledge to students and students' self-learning professional knowledge. Finally, the teaching of modern and contemporary literature courses is investigated and analyzed. The results of this experimental survey show that more than 40% of the learners believe that modern and contemporary culture courses help to develop their Chinese communication skills. At the same time, this course will help foreign students to better master Chinese and understand China, which is beneficial and harmless.

According to relevant studies, nearly 70 percent of Chinese students lack daily physical exercise. Physical quality is the primary factor and prerequisite of study and work, so how to improve the physical quality of primary and middle school students has become the top priority of physical education. Based on the requirements and guidance of China's physical education in the new curriculum standard, this paper innovates China's physical education classroom teaching to a certain extent based on deep learning algorithm. The final results show that the students who choose PE class based on deep learning algorithm account for about 85% of the total number of students, which exceeds the students who choose traditional PE class by 70%. Therefore, we believe that the estimation and recognition of students' movement posture in PE class can not only greatly improve students' enthusiasm for physical exercise but also avoid sports injuries caused by inaccurate operation in the process of exercise. Human posture estimation is to detect the position of each part of the human body from the image and calculate its direction and scale information. The advent of the era of big data is based on the relationship between multiple frames of images, while human posture recognition is based on the processing of single-frame static images. Correctly recognizing the pose information of multiple frames of continuous images still makes it possible to realize correct behavior analysis and understanding.;"[Tang, Yingting] Guangdong Univ Petrochem Technol, Maoming 525000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qiang] South Univ Sci & Technol China, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R China";"Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology; Southern University of Science & Technology";Tang, YT (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Petrochem Technol, Maoming 525000, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;2016122607@jou.edu.cn;;;;;;;17;0;0;1;23;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

To advance the topic of integrating learning engagement research with university teaching practice, accurate and efficient assessment, and analysis of students' classroom learning behavior engagement is very important. The recently proposed classroom behavior recognition algorithms have some limitations, such as the inability to quickly and accurately identify students' classroom behaviors because they do not consider the motion information of students between consecutive frames. In recent years, action recognition algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have improved significantly. To address the limitations of existing algorithms, in this study, a 3D-CNN is selected as a network model for classroom student behavior recognition, which increases information multisourcing and classroom student localization with high accuracy and robustness. For better analysis of human behavior in videos, the 3D convolution extends the 2D convolution to the spatial-temporal domain. In the proposed system, first of all, a real-time picture stream of each student is obtained by combining real-time target detection and tracking. Then, a deep spatiotemporal residual CNN is used to learn the spatiotemporal features of each student's behavior, so, as to achieve real-time recognition of classroom behaviors for multistudent targets in classroom teaching scenarios. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, different experiments are conducted using the labeled classroom behavior dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits better performance in classroom behavior recognition. The accurate recognition of classroom behaviors can assist the teachers and students to understand the classroom learning situation and help to promote the development of smart classroom.;"[Albert, Chuck Chung Yin; Li, Guang] City Univ Macau, Fac Data Sci, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yuqi] Minist Educ PRC, Macao Polytech Inst, Engn Res Ctr Appl Technol Machine Translat & Artif, Macau, Peoples R China; [Peng, Jun; Zhou, Jie] City Univ Macau, Sch Educ, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China; [Ran, Feng] Beijing Dongcheng Acad Educ Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng] Shandong Youth Univ Polit Sci, Sch Informat Engn, Jinan, Peoples R China";"City University of Macau; Macao Polytechnic University; City University of Macau; Shandong Youth University of Political Science";Peng, J (corresponding author), City Univ Macau, Sch Educ, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China.;"albert.chuck@bigfour.com.mo; sunyuqi@ipm.edu.mo; papertiger2022@126.com; d19092105030@cityu.mo; ranf_206@sina.com; wangzheng@sdyu.edu.cn; 303895934@qq.com";俊, 彭/KDM-7963-2024;俊, 彭/0000-0003-1802-7300;"Beijing Municipal Educational Science Thirteenth Five Year Plan General Project in 2019 Research on Evaluation Index System in the Context of General High School History Curriculum Reform [CDDB19182]; 2021 General Project of Beijing Society of Education Development and Application of WeChat Official Account for Departmental History Textbook Aided Teaching [DCYB2021-076]; 2021 Higher Education Fund of the Macao SAR Government [HSS-CITYU-2021-07]";"Beijing Municipal Educational Science Thirteenth Five Year Plan General Project in 2019 Research on Evaluation Index System in the Context of General High School History Curriculum Reform; 2021 General Project of Beijing Society of Education Development and Application of WeChat Official Account for Departmental History Textbook Aided Teaching; 2021 Higher Education Fund of the Macao SAR Government";This paper was supported by Beijing Municipal Educational Science Thirteenth Five Year Plan General Project in 2019 Research on Evaluation Index System in the Context of General High School History Curriculum Reform (Project no.

However, there is little research on the application of the Internet in solfeggio teaching, and there are some problems in the teaching process, such as nonstandard use methods, inability to highlight teaching objectives, and mismatch with students' professional level. On the premise of fully understanding the teaching objectives of solfeggio in China, this paper designs an experiential teaching system of solfeggio in normal universities based on machine learning algorithm, studies the application of digital technology in solfeggio, including Internet technology, multimedia digital technology, and the use of music software, and analyzes the auxiliary role of digital technology in solfeggio teaching by combining the specific teaching contents of online solfeggio teaching during the epidemic period. In this experiment, the average classification accuracy of WNB algorithm is 0.767, while that of BP algorithm is 0.683. Experimental results show that WNB algorithm outperforms BP algorithm in classification. At the same time, in terms of time efficiency, the average time consumption of WNB algorithm in this experiment is about 0.026 s, while that of BP algorithm is about 0.45 s. Compared with WNB algorithm, the time consumption of WNB algorithm is less. Through concrete practice, it is proved that the combination of solfeggio teaching and digital technology is of great significance to both teachers' teaching and students' learning.;"[Liu, Ke; Awang bin Othman, Johan] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Art, Gelugor 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Liu, Ke] GuiZhou Educ Univ, Sch Mus & Dance, Guiyang 550018, Guizhou, Peoples R China";"Universiti Sains Malaysia; Guizhou Education University";"Liu, K (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Art, Gelugor 11800, Penang, Malaysia.;Liu, K (corresponding author), GuiZhou Educ Univ, Sch Mus & Dance, Guiyang 550018, Guizhou, Peoples R China.";"liuke@gznc.edu.cn; j_othman@usm.my";;;;;;;23;1;1;2;6;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

J;Woodcock, J;;;;Woodcock, Jamie;;;Artificial intelligence at work: The problem of managerial control from call centers to transport platforms;FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"artificial intelligence; algorithmic management; labor process; call centers; platform work; gig economy";LABOR;There has been much recent research on the topic of artificial intelligence at work, which is increasingly featuring in more types of work and across the labor process. Much research takes the application of artificial intelligence, in its various forms, as a break from the previous methods of organizing work. Less is known about how these applications of artificial intelligence build upon previous forms of managerial control or are adapted in practice. This paper aims to situate the use of artificial intelligence by management within a longer history of control at work. In doing so, it seeks to draw out the novelty of the technology, while also critically appraising the impact of artificial intelligence as a managerial tool. The aim is to understand the contest at work over the introduction of these tools, taking call centers and transport platforms as case studies. Call centers are important because they have been a site of struggle over previous forms of electronic surveillance and computation control, providing important lessons for how artificial intelligence is, or may, be used in practice. In particular, this paper will draw out moments and tactics in algorithmic management has been challenged at work, using this as a discussion point for considering the possible future of artificial intelligence at work.;[Woodcock, Jamie] Open Univ, Dept People & Org, Milton Keynes, England;Open University - UK;Woodcock, J (corresponding author), Open Univ, Dept People & Org, Milton Keynes, England.;jamie.woodcock@googlemail.com;;;;;;;53;1;1;5;18;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2624-8212;;FRONT ARTIF INTELL;Front.

However, process and fault models are not usually available for complex productions plants and production data are usually unlabeled. Thus, to classify machine status, unsupervised approaches such as anomaly detection and signal processing strategies have to be employed. Due to the unsupervised nature of the problem, it is meaningful to apply several diagnostic algorithms to cover most of the process anomalous behaviors. Additionally, in some contexts, the experience of process operators in grasping the correct functioning of machines as well as their ability in understanding early signs of deterioration is relevant for the diagnosis of incoming failures. However, seldom these information can be included in failure diagnosis algorithms. In this paper, we propose a diagnostic scheme for condition monitoring of mechanical components. The proposed scheme combines anomaly detection algorithms, envelope analysis of vibration data, and eventually additional qualitative information on machine functioning. The combination of all the fault indicators is obtained leveraging on a fuzzy inference system. The proposed scheme is experimentally validated on a steel making plant with real process data, making use of heuristic information such monitoring reports of machine health status.;"[Mazzoleni, Mirko] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, I-24044 Bergamo, Italy; [Sarda, Kisan; Acernese, Antonio; Russo, Luigi; Glielmo, Luigi; Del Vecchio, Carmen] Univ Sannio, Piazza Roma, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Manfredi, Leonardo] Siderpotenza Pittini Grp, I-85100 Potenza, Italy";"University of Bergamo; University of Sannio";Sarda, K (corresponding author), Univ Sannio, Piazza Roma, I-82100 Benevento, Italy.;"mirko.mazzoleni@unibg.it; kirasarda@unisannio.it";"Russo, Luigi/IUM-4916-2023; Del Vecchio, Carmen/ADH-2368-2022; Mazzoleni, Mirko/ABD-6436-2021";"Russo, Luigi/0009-0002-7800-1858; Del Vecchio, Carmen/0000-0001-6937-9678; Mazzoleni, Mirko/0000-0002-7116-135X; Sarda, Kisan/0000-0002-0560-452X";MIUR, Italy [CUP F26C18000180005];MIUR, Italy(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR));Acknowledgments The authors are indebted to Pittini staff for their precious help dur-ing the data acquisition and comments on data results.

This teaching method can not only decompose dance movements more specifically, which is easy for students to understand and master, but also get rid of the time and space limitation in traditional dance teaching and provide more independent learning opportunities for students. The problem of low accuracy of dance movement recognition due to complex gesture changes in dance movements is addressed. To this end, this paper proposes a modified motion target detection algorithm based on GMM. The dance movement recognition algorithm first extracts the features of dance movements through a feature pyramid network, then uses a multi-feature fusion module to fuse multiple features to improve the algorithm's estimation of complex postures, and finally completes the recognition of dance movements. Experiments show that our method can maintain a certain recognition rate in the case where the background and target are easily confused, and can effectively improve the dance action recognition accuracy, thus realizing the action correction function for dancers. This also verifies the effectiveness of the action recognition algorithm for dance movement recognition.;"[Tian, Jing] Zhengzhou Tourism Coll, Coll Arts & Culture, Zhengzhou 451464, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaoqiang] Hainan Univ, Sch Mus & Dance, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China";Hainan University;Yang, XQ (corresponding author), Hainan Univ, Sch Mus & Dance, Haikou 570228, Hainan, Peoples R China.;991593@hainanu.edu.cn;Yang, Xiao-Qiang/C-6900-2014;;;;;;32;1;1;1;7;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1939-0114;1939-0122;;SECUR COMMUN NETW;Secur.

Among student groups at different levels, college students are of serious concern as they are an essential pillar of social and economic development, and their mental health has been the society's focus in recent years. With the increasing population leading to the increasing number of college students in our country, the competition for professional learning is also becoming fiercer, seriously affecting students' mental health. Little attention has been paid to adverse effects on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health in recent years. However, it is still of grave concern as the stress among students leads to depression, several diseases, and ultimately death. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of physical exercise interventions on stress groups irrespective of their (educational) levels. Physical activity can effectively release stress and is an excellent way to regulate emotions. For this reason, it is a task that the current universities must complete to strengthen physical exercise in students' mental health education. The paper highlights the impact of various social pressures on students' mental health, understands its underlying mechanisms, and explores feasible mitigation strategies for improving and schooling students' mental health. This paper proposes an integrated evaluation-based algorithm to explore the model of the intervention effect of physical exercise on college students. It takes college students as the representative of stress groups. The results show that daily physical activities can effectively relieve the stress of college students.;"[Yang, Bo] Tianjin Univ Sport, Sch Sports Econ & Management, Tianjin 301617, Peoples R China; [Yang, Bo] Tiangong Univ, Sports Dept, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Ding, Zhizhong] Tiangong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China";"Tianjin University of Sport; Tiangong University; Tiangong University";Ding, ZZ (corresponding author), Tiangong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.;"yangbo@tiangong.edu.cn; dzz@tiangong.edu.cn";Ding, Zhizhong/AGB-5625-2022;;;;;;41;0;0;1;8;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

J;"Qiu, L; Feng, W";;;;"Qiu, Lu; Feng, Wei";;;Resolution of English Event Pronouns Based on Machine Learning;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"TRANSLATION; ZERO";As the basis of machine translation, anaphora aims to let the machine determine the entity or event to which the sentence refers by exploring the anaphora relationship between sentences. Prior to this, the research on anaphora resolution mainly focused on the resolution of entity anaphora. Through unremitting efforts, the elimination of entity-reference relationship has achieved great success, but the equally important event reference has been stagnant. This means that we can promote the development of machine translation by enhancing event reference. In this paper, a new method is proposed, which uses the latest machine learning algorithm to eliminate English event pronouns. Through feature extraction, data preprocessing, and the introduction of end-to-end double-loop neural network and attention mechanism, the network's ability to acquire contextual features is improved, and finally, the purpose of eliminating English event pronouns is achieved. In the experimental part, this paper also conducts training and testing on the latest data set KBP. It is found that the model algorithm proposed in this paper can perform the task of experimental setup well, and the value of 40.3% F1 is given under CONLL evaluation index. This proves that the model can understand semantic information very effectively and extract relevant information from the given semantic information.;"[Qiu, Lu] Inst Int Educ, Jiangsu Vocat Coll Elect & Informat, Jiangsu 223003, Peoples R China; [Feng, Wei] Jiangsu Vocat Coll Finance & Econ, Sch Int Educ, Jiangsu 223003, Peoples R China";;Qiu, L (corresponding author), Inst Int Educ, Jiangsu Vocat Coll Elect & Informat, Jiangsu 223003, Peoples R China.;"108157@jsei.edu.cn; davidfeng2005@163.com";;;;;;;24;0;0;0;4;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

How to use genetic algorithm to optimize online classroom teaching system has become a research hotspot. Based on genetic algorithm, this paper proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm model based on the traditional algorithm. After setting the appropriate mutation probability, the model can improve the convergence speed. Moreover, based on adaptive genetic algorithm, combined with the direct value method and BT neural network theory, this paper constructs the online classroom teaching quality evaluation model and the teaching system test paper data model, and optimizes adaptive mutation genetic algorithm and BP neural network to evaluate the teaching effectiveness. Simulation experiments are carried out based on the algorithm model, and the visual parameter values are obtained. After experimental comparison, the initial value of the mutation rate is set between 0.002 and 0.004.

To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society's evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: Creative AI, Dancing with AI, and How to Train Your Robot. In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles-active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access - to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students' understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate.

We can only continue to promote the rapid development of university teaching in China by putting in place a solid management system. It is the foundation of college students' IPE in this era of rapid information technology development to accurately adapt to and understand the actual problems and requirements of IPE proposed by the development of the times and innovate and develop accordingly. Deep learning (DL) is a sophisticated machine learning algorithm that outperforms previous technologies in speech and image recognition. In this paper, DLNN (deep learning neural network) technology is applied to IPE evaluation and a set of university-specific IPE evaluation index systems is developed. The BPNN (BP Neural Network) evaluation model is used to train and study a specific amount of teaching quality data in the MATLAB simulation tool. On the prediction of IPE evaluation, the BPNN algorithm has a prediction error of about 0.050.4 according to the findings. The validity and accuracy of using the BPNN algorithm to model IPE quality are demonstrated.;"[Sheng, Shiwei] Xinyang Univ, Sch Marxism, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yong-ping] Xinyang Univ, Sch Polytech, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China";"Xinyang University; Xinyang University";Gao, YP (corresponding author), Xinyang Univ, Sch Polytech, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China.;"shengshiwei000@163.com; yongpinggao66@henu.edu.cn";;;;;;;20;2;2;7;29;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

J;Liu, WJ;;;;Liu, Wenjun;;;Cultivation of College English Network Autonomous Learning Ability Based on the Multisource Information Fusion Algorithm;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"MOTIVATION; STUDENTS";With the rapid development of science and technology, the new century has entered an era of ever-changing information. Lifelong learning and lifelong education have become the dominance of a new round of educational concepts. Therefore, it is urgent to cultivate learners' autonomous learning ability. Self-directed learning has been a major focus of foreign language education in recent years. This research mainly explores the cultivation of college English online autonomous learning ability based on the multisource information fusion algorithm. This research will use a multisource information fusion algorithm to collect factors such as motivation, learning time, and other factors of students' English learning from multiple dimensions and then evaluate the college English online self-learning ability. The questionnaire on the self-learning ability of college students in the network environment includes five dimensions: understanding of teachers' teaching objectives and requirements, formulation and planning of learning objectives, effective use of learning strategies, monitoring of the use of learning strategies, and monitoring and evaluation of the learning process. The results of the study found that the highest score of the control class was 96 and the highest score of the experimental class was 86. The average score of the control class was 73.6 and the average score of the experimental class was 78.4, indicating that the average score of the experimental class was 4.8 points higher than that of the control class, and the standard deviations of the two classes were, respectively, 8.05 and 6.51. High-level students are better at using the network for effective learning than low-level students. High-level students are better at choosing learning strategies that suit them than lower level students. The value of sig (2-tailed) in the t-test is 0.004, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, we conclude that there is a significant difference in the posttest results of the two classes, showing a significant difference. This research will help to promote the cultivation of college English online self-learning ability.;[Liu, Wenjun] Linyi Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Linyi 276005, Shandong, Peoples R China;Linyi University;Liu, WJ (corresponding author), Linyi Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Linyi 276005, Shandong, Peoples R China.;liuwenjun@lyu.edu.cn;liu, wen/HGE-3071-2022;;;;;;26;0;0;4;44;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

Generally, video super-resolution contains a significant component, i.e., motion compensation, which is used to estimate the displacement between successive video frames for temporal alignment. Optical flow, which can supply dense and sub-pixel motion between consecutive frames, is among the most common ways for this task. To obtain a good understanding of the effect that optical flow acts in video super-resolution, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive review on this subject for the first time. This investigation covers the following major topics: the function of super-resolution (i.e., why we require super-resolution); the concept of video super-resolution (i.e., what is video super-resolution); the description of evaluation metrics (i.e., how (video) super-resolution performs); the introduction of optical flow based video super-resolution; the investigation of using optical flow to capture temporal dependency for video super-resolution.

Big data characterized, among others, the data comes from multiple sources, multi-format, comply to 5-V's in nature (value, volume, velocity, variety, and veracity). Big data also constitutes structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured-data. These characteristics of big data formed big data ecosystem that have various active nodes involved. Regardless such complex characteristics of big data, the studies show that there exists inherent structure that can be very useful to provide meaningful solutions for various problems. One of the problems is anticipating proper action to students' achievement. It is common practice that lecturer treat his/her class with one-size-fits-all policy and strategy. Whilst, the degree of students' understanding, due to several factors, may not the same. Furthermore, it is often too late to take action to rescue the student's achievement in trouble. This study attempted to gather all possible features involved from multiple data sources: national education databases, reports, webpages and so forth. The multiple data sources comprise data on undergraduate students from 13 provinces in Indonesia, including students' academic histories, demographic profiles and socioeconomic backgrounds and institutional information (i.e. level of accreditation, programmes of study, type of university, geographical location). Gathered data is furthermore preprocessed using various techniques to overcome missing value, data categorisation, data consistency, data quality assurance, to produce relatively clean and sound big dataset. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed in order to reduce dimensions of big dataset and furthermore use K-Means methods to reveal clusters (inherent structure) that may occur in that big dataset. There are 7 clusters suggested by K-Means analysis: 1. very low-risk students, 2. low-risk students, 3. moderate-risk students, 4. fluctuating-risk students, 5. high risk students, 6. very high-risk students and, 7. fail students. Among the clusters unreveal, (1) a gap between public universities and private universities across the three regions in Indonesia, (2) a gap between STEM and non-STEM programmes of study, (3) a gap between rural versus urban, (4) a gap of accreditation status, (5) a gap of quality human resources distribution, etc. Further study, we will use the characteristics of each cluster to predict students' achievement based on students' profiles, and provide solutions and interventions strategies for students to improve their likely success.;"[Yunita, Ariana; Santoso, Harry B.] Univ Indonesia, Fac Comp Sci, Depok 16424, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Yunita, Ariana] Univ Pertamina, Fac Sci & Comp Sci, South Jakarta 12220, Indonesia; [Hasibuan, Zainal A.] Univ Dian Nuswantoro, Fac Comp Sci, Semarang 50131, Jawa Tengah, Indonesia";"University of Indonesia; Dian Nuswantoro University";Santoso, HB (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Fac Comp Sci, Depok 16424, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.;harrybs@cs.ui.ac.id;Santoso, Harry B./M-6069-2019;"Santoso, Harry B./0000-0003-0459-0493; Yunita, Ariana/0000-0001-7883-5065";Direktorat Riset dan Pengembangan (Risbang) Universitas Indonesia through Hibah Publikasi Terindeks Internasional (PUTI) [NKB 4061/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020];Direktorat Riset dan Pengembangan (Risbang) Universitas Indonesia through Hibah Publikasi Terindeks Internasional (PUTI);This research was supported by Direktorat Riset dan Pengembangan (Risbang) Universitas Indonesia through Hibah Publikasi Terindeks Internasional (PUTI) Q2 2020 (Number: NKB 4061/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020).;;44;2;3;3;23;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2196-1115;;J BIG DATA-GER;J.

Due to the advancements of computer and multimedia technology, many professional training programs have applied technology to provide richer learning content. Blended learning is a learning approach combining online and physical courses. In the blended learning mode, learners can not only learn through multimedia teaching materials, but also interact and practice with teachers and students in online and physical classrooms. However, the conventional blended learning (C-BL) mode mainly presents teaching content through online videos and physical courses. In such a learning environment with one-way information transmission and without experience, it is not easy for most learners to experience the actual situations encountered in the professional training process, which affects their judgment and actual handling performance. In order to tackle this problem, this research adopted spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) technology and applied it in a general registered nurse (RN) training program via a blended learning mode. To verify the effects of this teaching approach, a quasi-experimental study was conducted in a RN training program in a large-scale hospital. The experimental group employed the SVVR-BL mode while the control group employed the C-BL mode. The results indicated that the SVVR-BL mode could not only improve learners' learning achievement, but also enhance their problem-solving tendency, metacognition tendency, and classroom engagement. The practical skills test results in the workplace further implied that, compared to the learners who adopted the C-BL mode, learners who adopted the SVVR-BL mode had better judgment, analysis, and overall performance of the handling process when encountering practical problems. As a result, SVVR-BL not only helped learners gain knowledge and improve their higher order thinking, but also assisted them in applying what they had learned to solve real problems. This result can serve as an important reference for SVVR-BL studies and the design of professional training programs in the future.;"[Huang, Hsin; Hwang, Gwo-Jen] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Digital Learning & Educ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Hsin] Triserv Gen Hosp, Natl Def Med Ctr, Dept Nursing, Taipei, Taiwan; [Jong, Morris Siu-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jong, Morris Siu-Yung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Learning Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"National Taiwan University of Science & Technology; National Defense Medical Center; Tri-Service General Hospital; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong";Hwang, GJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Digital Learning & Educ, Taipei, Taiwan.;gjhwang.academic@gmail.com;Hwang, Gwo-Jen/G-6454-2012;"Huang, Hsin/0000-0003-1901-0631; Jong, Morris/0000-0001-9186-0484";"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 111-2410-H- 016-001, MOST 111-2410-H-011-007-MY3]; Tri-Service General Hospital; National Taiwan University of Science and Technology [TSGH-NTUST-109-05]";"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Tri-Service General Hospital; National Taiwan University of Science and Technology";This study is supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under contract numbers MOST 111-2410-H- 016-001 and MOST 111-2410-H-011-007-MY3.

J;Tang, X;;;;Tang, Xin;;;Application and Design of Drama Popular Science Education Using Augmented Reality;SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;In the 21st century, the research and development of all kinds of intelligent equipment have become an increasingly important part of people's daily life. Various emerging technologies are developed based on hardware equipment, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which fully utilize computer vision technology to accomplish various purposes. Nowadays, it is difficult to carry out opera popular science education in China. Because opera teaching is boring and some traditional opera knowledge is obscure and difficult to understand, it cannot arouse students' interest in learning. Therefore, this article uses VR technology to stimulate students' learning initiative and complete drama science popularization education with rich and colorful teaching means. It first briefly introduces the concept and characteristics of AR technology. After that, it establishes an AR-enabled drama application as an education model based on the statistical entity recognition algorithm and designs the drama popular science education app. Besides, it completes the drama animation design, character modeling design, drama scene design, logo pattern design, and animation design. Finally, from the two points of students' mastery of opera and learning opera knowledge, the actual use effect of this application is analyzed. The results show that this application can help students better learn opera: 42% of students can better master opera singing, 23% of students say they can master other types of opera, 18% of students can better learn and master opera movements and posture, and 10% and 7% of students can master a lot of opera knowledge.;[Tang, Xin] Shenyang Normal Univ, Drama Arts Sch, Shenyang 110034, Liaoning, Peoples R China;Shenyang Normal University;Tang, X (corresponding author), Shenyang Normal Univ, Drama Arts Sch, Shenyang 110034, Liaoning, Peoples R China.;tys1006@synu.edu.cn;;;;;;;31;3;3;11;49;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1058-9244;1875-919X;;SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH;Sci.

Currently, deep learning (DL) is enabling DRL to effectively solve various intractable problems in various fields including computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, robotics, to name a few. Most importantly, DRL algorithms are also being employed in audio signal processing to learn directly from speech, music and other sound signals in order to create audio-based autonomous systems that have many promising applications in the real world. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the progress of DRL in the audio domain by bringing together research studies across different but related areas in speech and music.

J;Wang, TF;;;;Wang, Tingfei;;;Construction and Data Integration of College Student Management Model Based on Human-Computer Interaction Data Acquisition and Monitoring System;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;CONSOLIDATION;The research on the management mode of students in colleges and universities is helpful in cultivating students' autonomous learning, self-education, and self-service ability. However, there are still some deficiencies in the construction of college student management model. This paper aims to study and analyze the construction and data integration of college student management mode under the data acquisition and monitoring system based on human-computer interaction. Firstly, this paper analyzes the human-computer interaction technology. Robots participate in human activities and coexist with people, which is called human-computer interaction. Human-computer interaction technology mainly includes voice interaction, image interaction, data interaction, and action interaction. Then, the sensor data acquisition algorithm based on cooperative communication is analyzed, and finally, the management mode of students is experimentally explored. The composition of the management system of college students is realized by establishing the management subject, management object, and management environment of students. The experimental results of this paper show that, in the investigation of the student union management system, 43% of the participants chose the system exists, but it needs to be improved, and 31.5% of the participants chose the system is perfect. The system is not perfect accounted for 14.8%, and 89.2% of the participants believed that there was a system. Obviously, whether it is the system, the enforcement strength, or the standard level, there is still room for improvement. We can strengthen the connotation construction of the student union and improve the management function of the student union, deepen the understanding of the status and role of the student union, build a standardized evaluation system for the student union, and strengthen the internal organization of the student union.;[Wang, Tingfei] Zhejiang Ind Polytech Coll, Shaoxing 312000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China;;Wang, TF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Ind Polytech Coll, Shaoxing 312000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.;tingfeiwang@zjipc.com;;;;;;;15;0;0;5;16;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

J;"Wu, R; Xu, J";;;;"Wu, Rong; Xu, Jian";;;RETRACTED: Design of Counselor Job Matching and Ideological and Political Education Methods Integrating Deep Learning Model (Retracted Article);WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING;;;English;"Article; Retracted Publication";;;;;;;;In the process of civic and political education, counselors should not only provide good service guidance for students' learning but also deeply understand students' ideological dynamics and psychological conditions. This would help to guide them in establishing healthy ideological concepts and moral qualities. The continuous development of ideological education cannot be achieved without the assistance of an experienced counselor team. There is a nationwide requirement to strengthen the professionalism of college counselors which is presently lagging. There exists a gap between the demand of the job seekers and the relevant products who fail to meet the need of the college administrators, working counselors, and other groups. The present paper focuses on providing solutions to the current problems pertinent to inaccurate matching of counselor positions in ideological and political education, the lagging information feedback, and the existence of imperfect early warning intervention mechanism. The paper proposes an integrated deep learning model which automates the learning of a large number of college students' user behaviors using deep learning algorithms thereby incorporating early warning classifiers. This helps to establish a model enabling accurate counselor job matching and ideological and political education methods. Simulation is used to verify the effectiveness of the model using relevant databases which establishes the superiority of the proposed method in resolving mismatch issues in human resources, handles imbalances in actual effectiveness, and also ensures lagging information feedback in the process of providing dynamic early warning in case of college and university level ideological and political education.;"[Wu, Rong] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Zhenjiang 212000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jian] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Zhenjiang 212000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China";"Jiangsu University of Science & Technology; Jiangsu University of Science & Technology";Wu, R (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Zhenjiang 212000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;"wurong@just.edu.cn; xujian@just.edu.cn";;;"Jiangsu University of Science and Technology 2020 China Investment Management Innovation Award Key project Practice and Exploration of Experiential Ideological and Political Education in the Context of Epidemic Prevention and Control and Post-Epidemic Situ [2020XGJP01]; University Ideological and Political Education Special Project of 2021 Jiangsu Social Science Application Research Excellent Project Research on the Work Path of Ideological and Political Education in Colleges and Universities Based on the Integration of T [21SZB-040]";"Jiangsu University of Science and Technology 2020 China Investment Management Innovation Award Key project Practice and Exploration of Experiential Ideological and Political Education in the Context of Epidemic Prevention and Control and Post-Epidemic Situ; University Ideological and Political Education Special Project of 2021 Jiangsu Social Science Application Research Excellent Project Research on the Work Path of Ideological and Political Education in Colleges and Universities Based on the Integration of T";This work was supported by the Jiangsu University of Science and Technology 2020 China Investment Management Innovation Award Key project Practice and Exploration of Experiential Ideological and Political Education in the Context of Epidemic Prevention and Control and Post-Epidemic Situation (2020XGJP01) and University Ideological and Political Education Special Project of 2021 Jiangsu Social Science Application Research Excellent Project Research on the Work Path of Ideological and Political Education in Colleges and Universities Based on the Integration of The Second Classroom and Ideological and Political Education (21SZB-040).;;20;1;1;2;18;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

The definition of cross-cultural: have a full and correct understanding of cultural phenomena, customs, and habits that are different or conflicting with the national culture, and accept and adapt to it with an inclusive attitude on this basis. Therefore, for Chinese universities, the focus is on cultivating highly qualified talents with intercultural communication skills for the country's economic development. Intercultural communication skills are an important part of students' language communication skills. China's business English teaching has also begun to focus on the cultivation of students' cross-cultural communication skills, but the effect is not satisfactory. In business English teaching, the most important thing is to improve students' professional competence and business English expertise, and to cultivate foreign language talents with cross-cultural quality and global awareness. Based on the above reasons, this paper proposes a research on the integration of business English teaching and intercultural communication competence cultivation based on intelligent algorithms. First, this paper adopts the literature method to understand the difficulties in traditional business English teaching and the problems in the process of cultivating intercultural communication competence; then, it adopts the inductive-deductive method of intelligent algorithm and action research method to study the mode of cultivating intercultural communication competence and comprehensive experimental research. Finally, after comprehensive analysis, it was concluded that: the number of domestic literature on intercultural communication competence cultivation increased by 11.98%, and the number of literature was generally on the rise; there were significant differences in test results; the experimental students who were satisfied with the cultivation model studied in this paper reached 45.6%. This article attempts to investigate and analyze the needs of English majors for the cultivation of business English intercultural communicative competence, so as to provide a reference for cultivating students' intercultural communicative competence. The above data fully indicate that the use of contextual teaching method to cultivate intercultural communication skills in business English courses is effective, attracting students' enjoyment, cultivating their intercultural communication skills, enhancing their understanding of business etiquette, and improving their ability to conduct business conversations.

Affected by the epidemic, online teaching has been implemented all over the country, forming an education model of dual integration of online and offline teaching. However, the disadvantages of online teaching are also very obvious; that is, teachers cannot understand the students' listening status in real-time. Therefore, our study adopts automatic face detection and expression recognition based on a deep learning framework and other related technologies to solve this problem, and it designs an analysis system of students' class concentration based on expression recognition. The students' class concentration analysis system can help teachers detect students' class concentration and improve the efficiency of class evaluation. In this system, OpenCV is used to call the camera to collect the students' listening status in real-time, and the MTCNN algorithm is used to detect the face of the video to frame the location of the student's face image. Finally, the obtained face image is used for real-time expression recognition by using the VGG16 network added with ECANet, and the students' emotions in class are obtained. The experimental results show that the method in our study can more accurately identify students' emotions in class and carry out a teaching effect evaluation, which has certain application value in intelligent education fields, such as the smart classroom and distance learning. For example, a teaching evaluation module can be added to the teaching software, and teachers can know the listening emotions of each student in class while lecturing.";"[Hou, Changbo; Ai, Jiajun; Lin, Yun; Guan, Chenyang; Li, Jiawen; Zhu, Wenyu] Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China";Harbin Engineering University;Lin, Y (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.;"houchangbo@hrbeu.edu.cn; aijiajun@hrbeu.edu.cn; linyun@hrbeu.edu.cn; _victor_guan@hrbeu.edu.cn; 1003453492@hrbeu.edu.cn; zwy3743@hrbeu.edu.cn";"Zhu, Wenyu/GRR-3601-2022; Li, Jiawen/AAR-8988-2021; Lin, Yun/C-4759-2019";"Zhu, Wenyu/0000-0002-1438-9489; Li, Jiawen/0000-0003-3684-4785; Lin, Yun/0000-0003-1379-9301; Hou, Changbo/0000-0002-6421-3481";"Heilongjiang Province Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project [SJGY20200146]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62001137]; Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province [JJ2019LH2398]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3072021CF0805]";"Heilongjiang Province Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)";"This research was funded by the Heilongjiang Province Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Project (SJGY20200146);the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62001137); the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (JJ2019LH2398); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (3072021CF0805).";;28;10;10;1;26;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1999-5903;;FUTURE INTERNET;Future Internet;JUN;2022;14;6;;;;;;;177;10.3390/fi14060177;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi14060177;;;12;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;2O5MM;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000819102000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The disease has spread to most countries and poses a challenge to the healthcare system. Contact tracing technology is an effective way for public health to deal with diseases. Many experts have studied traditional contact tracing and developed digital contact tracking. In order to better understand the field of contact tracking, it is necessary to analyze the development of contact tracking in the field of computer science by bibliometrics. The purpose of this research is to use literature statistics and topic analysis to characterize the research literature of contact tracking in the field of computer science, to gain an in-depth understanding of the literature development status of contact tracking and the trend of hot topics over the past decade. In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, we conducted a bibliometric study in this paper. The study uses data collected from the Scopus database. Which contains more than 10,000 articles, including more than 2,000 in the field of computer science. For popular trends, we use VOSviewer for visual analysis. The number of contact tracking documents published annually in the computer field is increasing. At present, there are 200 to 300 papers published in the field of computer science each year, and the number of uncited papers is relatively small. Through the visual analysis of the paper, we found that the hot topic of contact tracking has changed from the past mathematical model, biological model, and algorithm to the current digital contact tracking, privacy, and mobile application and other topics. Contact tracking is currently a hot research topic. By selecting the most cited papers, we can display high-quality literature in contact tracking and characterize the development trend of the entire field through topic analysis. This is useful for students and researchers new to field of contact tracking ai well as for presenting our results to other subjects.

Data mining makes it possible to explore and find unseen connections between variables and facts observed in different domains, helping us to better understand reality. The programming methods and frameworks used to analyse data have evolved over time. Currently, the use of pipelining schemes is the most reliable way of analysing data and due to this, several important companies are currently offering this kind of services. Moreover, several frameworks compatible with different programming languages are available for the development of computational pipelines and many research studies have addressed the optimization of data processing speed. However, as this study shows, the presence of early error detection techniques and developer support mechanisms is very limited in these frameworks. In this context, this study introduces different improvements, such as the design of different types of constraints for the early detection of errors, the creation of functions to facilitate debugging of concrete tasks included in a pipeline, the invalidation of erroneous instances and/or the introduction of the burst-processing scheme. Adding these functionalities, we developed Big Data Pipelining for Java (BDP4J, https://github.com/sing-group/bdp4j), a fully functional new pipelining framework that shows the potential of these features.;"[Novo-Loures, Maria; Lage, Yeray; Pavon, Reyes; Laza, Rosalia; Ruano-Ordas, David; Ramon Mendez, Jose] Univ Vigo, Dept Comp Sci, ESEI Escuela Super Ingn Informat, Edificio Politecn,Campus Univ Lagoas S-N, Orense 32004, Spain; [Novo-Loures, Maria; Pavon, Reyes; Laza, Rosalia; Ruano-Ordas, David; Ramon Mendez, Jose] Univ Vigo, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp SI4, CINBIO, Orense 32004, Spain; [Novo-Loures, Maria; Pavon, Reyes; Laza, Rosalia; Ruano-Ordas, David; Ramon Mendez, Jose] SERGAS UVIGO, Galicia Sur Hlth Res Inst IIS Galicia Sur, SING Res Grp, Vigo, Spain";"Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo";"Méndez, JR (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Comp Sci, ESEI Escuela Super Ingn Informat, Edificio Politecn,Campus Univ Lagoas S-N, Orense 32004, Spain.;Méndez, JR (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp SI4, CINBIO, Orense 32004, Spain.;Méndez, JR (corresponding author), SERGAS UVIGO, Galicia Sur Hlth Res Inst IIS Galicia Sur, SING Res Grp, Vigo, Spain.";moncho.mendez@uvigo.es;"Laza, Rosalía/F-4646-2016; Méndez Reboredo, José Ramón/F-3993-2016; Ruano-Ordás, David/G-8482-2017; Pavón, Reyes/F-2302-2016";"Méndez Reboredo, José Ramón/0000-0002-1935-4760; Ruano-Ordás, David/0000-0002-6050-373X;";"Xunta de Galicia [ED481D-2021/024]; project Semantic Knowledge Integration for ContentBased Spam Filtering from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (SMEIC) [TIN2017-84658-C2-1-R]; State Research Agency (SRA); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Conselleria de Educacion, Universidades e Formacion Profesional (Xunta de Galicia) [ED431C2018/55-GRC]";"Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); project Semantic Knowledge Integration for ContentBased Spam Filtering from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (SMEIC); State Research Agency (SRA); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)); Conselleria de Educacion, Universidades e Formacion Profesional (Xunta de Galicia)(Xunta de Galicia)";"D.

However, due to the wide range of machine vision applications, this research focuses on its application in video surveillance. In the era of artificial intelligence, the detection and tracking of moving objects have always been a key issue in video surveillance. The simulation of human vision is realized by combining the relevant functions of the computer and the image acquisition device, which enables the computer to have the ability to recognize the surrounding environment through images. The intelligent video analysis technology can automatically analyze and extract the key useful information from the video source with the powerful data processing ability of the computer, so as to realize the computer's understanding of the video. It allows the computer to understand what is shown in the video or what kind of event happened and provides a new method and reliable basis for accident detection and accident analysis. Therefore, after a brief introduction to machine vision, moving target monitoring methods, and intelligent tracking algorithms, this paper will focus on moving target monitoring and intelligent tracking strategies for video surveillance. In addition, this paper will focus on introducing the principle of intelligent tracking algorithm through formulas and compare the accuracy and success rate of target monitoring and intelligent tracking between the machine vision-based algorithm and other algorithms during the experiment. Finally, experiments show that the monitoring and tracking effect of machine vision combined with cloud is the best, and the overall average can reach 85.7%. Based on this, this paper fully confirms the feasibility of the moving target monitoring and intelligent tracking algorithm based on machine vision.;"[Xu, Pengfei; Zhou, Zhiqing; Geng, Zexun] Pingdingshan Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Pingdingshan 467000, Henan, Peoples R China";Pingdingshan University;Xu, PF (corresponding author), Pingdingshan Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Pingdingshan 467000, Henan, Peoples R China.;3221@pdsu.edu.cn;;Xu, Pengfei/0000-0002-7304-734X;Key Scientific Research Projects of Henan Higher Education Institutions [21A520034];Key Scientific Research Projects of Henan Higher Education Institutions;This work was supported by the Key Scientific Research Projects of Henan Higher Education Institutions under Grant 21A520034.;;29;2;2;0;26;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

J;Zhang, S;;;;Zhang, Shuang;;;RETRACTED: Feasibility of Music Composition Using Deep Learning-Based Quality Classification Models (Retracted Article);WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING;;;English;"Article; Retracted Publication";;;;;;;PEDAGOGIES;Polyphonic music technique is the foundation of students' understanding of musical works. The mastery of polyphonic music techniques enables students to better understand the meaning of musical works and get in touch with the soul of music. Hence, teaching polyphonic music is a compulsory course for composition theory. In the past, all the concepts taught in the composition theory class included the use of the main key, and the minimal amount of polyphonic music works was covered. Also, even if students encountered polyphonic music, a brief inclusion of the same would be included in teaching, creating difficulties for the students to understand polyphonic music well. Intelligent music composition, however, refers to a formalized process that allows the composer to create music with the help of a computer, ensuring minimal human intervention. With the popularity of the Internet and the rapid development of multimedia technology, the majority of the users now use online music applications. Therefore, the need to automatically organize and manage the huge amount of music data effectively has evolved. Studying intelligent music composition helps to understand and simulate the way of thinking of composers in making compositions. It also helps to assist composers in making music, in addition to entertaining people. Considering the aforementioned, the present paper uses a deep learning-based quality classification model for music composition feasibility. The experimental results show that the algorithm has the advantages of fast detection speed and high quality. It helps composers to compose music, greatly reduces the workload, and also ensures certain promotion value.;[Zhang, Shuang] Jining Inst, Sch Mus, Jining 272000, Shandong, Peoples R China;;Zhang, S (corresponding author), Jining Inst, Sch Mus, Jining 272000, Shandong, Peoples R China.;zzn22372226@jnxy.edu.cn;;;"special program of Studies on Carry Forward Guchui Music (folk music with southwestern characteristics of Shandong province) to Develop in an Innovative Fashion under the main program of traditional cultural and socioeconomic advancement - Government of [CZ1710051]; key program in science and art field of the Survey on Recent Phenomena and Reformations of Piano Grading Tests in China's Shandong Province - Government of Shandong Province [2014341]";"special program of Studies on Carry Forward Guchui Music (folk music with southwestern characteristics of Shandong province) to Develop in an Innovative Fashion under the main program of traditional cultural and socioeconomic advancement - Government of; key program in science and art field of the Survey on Recent Phenomena and Reformations of Piano Grading Tests in China's Shandong Province - Government of Shandong Province";This work was supported by a special program of Studies on Carry Forward Guchui Music (folk music with southwestern characteristics of Shandong province) to Develop in an Innovative Fashion under the main program of traditional cultural and socioeconomic advancement, sponsored by the Government of Shandong Province, China, in 2017, program No. CZ1710051, and a key program in science and art field of the Survey on Recent Phenomena and Reformations of Piano Grading Tests in China's Shandong Province, sponsored by the Government of Shandong Province, 2014, program No. 2014341.;;33;0;0;0;7;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

Conventional machine learning has a strong dependence on massive amounts of training data which are domain specific to understand their latent patterns. In contrast, Domain adaptation and Transfer learning methods are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with solving the inescapable problem of insufficient training data by relaxing the domain dependence hypothesis. In this contribution, this issue has been addressed and by making a novel combination of both the methods we develop a computationally efficient and practical algorithm to solve boundary value problems based on nonlinear partial differential equations. We adopt a meshfree analysis framework to integrate the prevailing geometric modelling techniques based on NURBS and present an enhanced deep collocation approach that also plays an important role in the accuracy of solutions. We start with a brief introduction on how these methods expand upon this framework.

As one of the important research directions in the field of visual intelligence, this technology has a wide range of application scenarios in the fields of mobile robots, drones, and intelligent driving. However, in practical applications, there may be problems such as inaccurate prediction of semantic labels, loss of segmented objects and background edge information. This paper proposes an improved semantic segmentation network that combines self-attention module and neural architecture search (NAS) method. The method first uses the NAS method to find a semantic segmentation network with multiple resolution branches. During the search process, the searched network structure is adjusted by combining the self-attention module, and then combined with the semantic segmentation networks searched by different branches to integrate into two semantic segmentation network models with different complexity, and finally integrate two network models with different complexity according to the current general teacher-student framework. The input image will first pass through the high complexity model to obtain more accurate parameters, which will affect the training weight of the student network, then pass the image into the low-complexity model to get the final predicted result. The experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset show that the accuracy of the algorithm is 69.8 %, the inference speed is 166.4 FPS, and the actual image segmentation speed is 48/s.

At the same time, college students must be encouraged to follow well-rounded education and struggle to be well-prepared for the challenges of the new era. In order to raise students' understanding of the critical role that political and ideological education plays in their academic success, it is authoritative that efforts to integrate these two spheres of learning be extended and new encounters made. That's what prompted this study, which is focused on assessing college students' level of ideological and political education administration, and it uses a mixture of big data technologies as well as artificial intelligence (AI) to do it. The accuracy of the traditional ideological as well as political education management quality assessment algorithm is not high, feature information extracted by the single-scale neural network (NN) is not rich enough, and the multiscale convolutional network (CN) fusion cannot consider the different values and importance for each scale.

See vol. 2022, 2022);SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS;;;English;"Article; Retracted Publication";;;;;;;DESIGN;An essential role in improving educational informatization and encouraging new approaches to education is played by educational technology, a specialist field that supports both theorising and doing in this area. When it comes to learning educational technology, students must have excellent professional knowledge and abilities, as well as a thorough understanding of data. Harr-NMF feature extraction for educational technology teaching large data systems is the focus of this project. With the help of big data technology, the construction of a teaching resource sharing system provides useful solutions for the storage and sharing of current and future massive teaching resources, enables fast and accurate analysis and retrieval of massive teaching resources and data, improves the security and scalability of the system while maintaining system stability, and promotes education teaching informatization to a new level. The system can be used to analyze and retrieve data quickly and accurately. By mapping different types of Harr-NMF features into a gradient matrix using grayscale projection, pattern classification is performed through the simplified gradient matrix as features. The algorithm complexity of feature extraction is eventually reduced to a great extent by the fast advantage of feature extraction by this algorithm. The Harr-NMF algorithm and the similarity relation matrix are used to obtain the optimal parameter values and the corresponding affiliation matrix and class centers, thus providing effective initial values for Harr-NMF, which effectively solves the problems of slow convergence and easy to fall into local minima of the Harr-NMF algorithm. The algorithm of this paper is compared with several improved algorithms of Harr-NMF in terms of convergence, recognition rate, and other performance to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this paper. With a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches, the data literacy of teaching educational technology is dissected and constructed to enhance its data literacy and improve the quality of education technology discipline personnel training.;"[Mojtahe, Kaza] Gingko Coll Hospitality Management, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China; Kyrgyz Turkish Manas Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan";Kyrgyz Turkish Manas University;Mojtahe, K (corresponding author), Gingko Coll Hospitality Management, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China.;"fusiyi869251@163.com; kaza.mojtahe@mail.cu.edu.kg";;Mojtahe, Kaza/0000-0001-9362-6405;;;;;25;2;2;4;18;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1939-0114;1939-0122;;SECUR COMMUN NETW;Secur.

During emergencies, users can post rescue requests along with their addresses on social media, while volunteers can search for those messages and send help. However, efficiently leveraging social media in rescue operations remains challenging because of the lack of tools to identify rescue request messages on social media automatically and rapidly. Analyzing social media data, such as Twitter data, relies heavily on Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to extract information from texts. The introduction of bidirectional transformers models, such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, has significantly outperformed previous NLP models in numerous text analysis tasks, providing new opportunities to precisely understand and classify social media data for diverse applications. This study developed and compared ten VictimFinder models for identifying rescue request tweets, three based on milestone NLP algorithms and seven BERT-based. A total of 3191 manually labeled disaster-related tweets posted during 2017 Hurricane Harvey were used as the training and testing datasets. We evaluated the performance of each model by classification accuracy, computation cost, and model stability. Experiment results show that all BERT-based models have significantly increased the accuracy of categorizing rescue-related tweets. The best model for identifying rescue request tweets is a customized BERT-based model with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. Its F1-score is 0.919, which outperforms the baseline model by 10.6%. The developed models can promote social media use for rescue operations in future disaster events.;"[Zhou, Bing; Zou, Lei; Lin, Binbin; Yang, Mingzheng; Cai, Heng; Abedin, Joynal; Mandal, Debayan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Mostafavi, Ali; Gharaibeh, Nasir] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA";"Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station";Zou, L (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.;lzou@tamu.edu;"Mandal, Debayan/IAQ-7949-2023; Mostafavi, Ali/R-2133-2018; Lin, Binbin/GRX-4342-2022; Mandal, Debayan/HIK-2341-2022; Zou, Lei/AAV-8227-2020; Abedin, Joynal/AAE-8574-2022";"Zou, Lei/0000-0001-6206-3558; Abedin, Joynal/0000-0001-6203-0959; Cai, Heng/0000-0001-6068-5150";"U.S. National Science Foundation [1931301]; X-Grant program under the Texas A&M University President's Excellence Fund; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering [1931301] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";"U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); X-Grant program under the Texas A&M University President's Excellence Fund; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))";This article is based on work supported by two research grants.

Moreover, both theoretical research and professional discipline construction are still very backward. In order to improve the efficiency of music teaching in colleges and universities, this paper applies the information system optimization algorithm to the intelligent analysis of music education in colleges and universities, selects the appropriate method for music information processing, and builds the music education system in colleges and universities on this basis. At the same time, this paper compiles a music system questionnaire for the two main groups (teachers and students) who use the music system to understand the needs of teachers and students for the music system. Then, this paper analyzes the feasibility of the system, constructs an intelligent music education system in colleges and universities, and verifies the effect of the system in combination with experiments. In addition, this paper evaluates the music information processing and educational effect of the system in combination with the actual situation and counts the test results.

J;Yan, F;;;;Yan, Fei;;;Music Psychological Meta-Analysis and Real-Time Measurement Algorithm Based on Nonlinear Dynamic Incremental Internal Model Algorithm;SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; QUESTIONNAIRE";As an important part of aesthetic education, music is the artistic expression of human emotions. It has a crucial impact on the cultivation of individual music perception ability, music aesthetic ability, music creation ability, etc. The degree of influence of emotions and values in music runs through the individual. This study introduces a method to independently design a predictive controller using the theoretical framework of the state-space method. Since the same results as DMC can be derived, it can be regarded as an understanding of DMC in the time domain. We take the asymptotically stable object of SISO as the model and use the step response coefficient to directly model, but this method makes the control uncontrollable, so we use the method of adding the correction parameter to make the observable process more effective. The advantages of one-time online optimization can reduce the amount of calculation and greatly enhance the robustness in the control process. In order to study the dynamic characteristics of the system, an internal model control system is introduced. By studying the closed-loop stability of the internal model system, the internal model structure of the dynamic matrix control system is studied, and its dynamic characteristics are further studied. When analyzing the dynamic characteristics, we can know that the dynamic characteristics of the system only depend on the object characteristics and control strategies, and have nothing to do with the model length. This study introduces the basic structure, main properties, and design method of the internal model controller. On the basis of conventional internal model control, an enhanced internal model control method is introduced. Through the analysis of the sensitivity function and the complementary sensitivity function, the robust performance and robust stability of the enhanced internal model control system are studied. Music learning psychology is related to the effect of music teaching. Since individual psychological development is dynamic and controllable, by grasping students' music learning motivation and music psychological ability, we can well practice the concept of contemporary new curriculum standards and implement high-quality music courses. This study mainly discusses the music learning psychology itself, the analysis of real-time measurement results, and the analysis of teaching countermeasures, and does some research on music theory and teaching practice. Through real-time measurement research, it can be concluded that the real-time measurement results are relatively optimistic, which shows that teachers can maintain students' learning well as long as they use teaching methods that conform to students' learning psychology. The nonlinear dynamic incremental internal model algorithm can improve students' various music psychological abilities and achieve the expected music teaching goals.;[Yan, Fei] Jiaozuo Normal Coll, Mus Acad, Jiaozuo 454000, Henan, Peoples R China;;Yan, F (corresponding author), Jiaozuo Normal Coll, Mus Acad, Jiaozuo 454000, Henan, Peoples R China.;1295003029@jzsz.edu.cn;;;Music Academy, Jiaozuo Normal College;Music Academy, Jiaozuo Normal College;This work was supported by Music Academy, Jiaozuo Normal College.;;28;1;1;0;7;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1058-9244;1875-919X;;SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH;Sci.

In order to extract useful information from these massive information, support teachers' teaching activities, improve teaching quality, provide learners with personalized learning support, and teach students according to their aptitude, educational big data analysis has attracted extensive attention of educators. Under the impact of informatization, education and information technology are deeply integrated, and network education is in the ascendant. At the same time, the theories and methods of artificial intelligence are gradually applied to the field of education. Learning analysis, data mining, and other analysis methods provide effective analysis methods for online learning process and learning effect. This paper studies the design of online learning early warning model based on artificial intelligence. When the system is implemented, based on the existing evaluation index system, the online learning early warning model of analytic hierarchy process is introduced to give different evaluation indexes unequal weights to ensure the fairness of evaluation. On the basis of understanding the artificial intelligence algorithm, the corresponding detection indicators should also be selected according to the objectives of the online learning early warning model and the needs of the actual work of network operation and maintenance.

It revolves around all the data and continuously excavates some of the potentially valuable data information. This information has great application value. This is a dynamic and interactive process. Deep learning is an important branch of machine learning, and the introduction of deep learning theory has promoted the development of artificial intelligence. Swimming is a rather special sport. From the perspective of special characteristics, the body is in an unstable state during swimming, there is no fixed fulcrum, and it is necessary to fight against water resistance in the water. In the case of maintaining the best streamlined and reducing resistance as much as possible, through the power forward movement method brought by rowing and kicking, the training of swimming-specific strength is also unique to the project. In this study, the application of deep learning and data mining technology to the optimization of swimming athletes' training mode is proposed, and algorithms such as neural network and support vector machine are expounded. This paper adopts two different training methods. That is, the experimental group adopts functional training. The control group used traditional training to compare the special performance of the two groups of athletes before and after physical training. In this way, we can understand the changes of traditional training and functional training on the performance of swimmers, compare the methods of the two groups of athletes and provide swimmers with more scientific and effective training methods. The experimental results of this paper show that through the data mining technology experiment, the main item test scores of the two groups of subjects before and after the experiment were p=0.004, which was less than 0.01, showing a very significant difference. This shows that the use of deep learning and data mining technology has a very significant effect on swimming athletes in training to improve performance.;"[Liu, Shuai] Hunan Univ Humanities Sci & Technol, Phys Culture Inst, Loudi 417000, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shuze] Linyi Univ, Sch Sports & Hlth, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shuze] Pai Chai Univ, Dept Leisure Sports, Daejeon 35345, South Korea";"Hunan University Of Humanities, Science & Technology; Linyi University; Pai Chai University";"Sun, SZ (corresponding author), Linyi Univ, Sch Sports & Hlth, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Sun, SZ (corresponding author), Pai Chai Univ, Dept Leisure Sports, Daejeon 35345, South Korea.";sunshuze@lyu.edu.cn;;;;;;;25;0;0;1;13;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

There are, however, limited efforts on providing teachers with sufficient knowledge and skills to integrate ML into teaching. Our study addresses this gap by proposing a professional development (PD) program named ML4STEM. Based on existing research on supporting teacher learning in innovative technology integration, ML4STEM is composed of Teachers-as-Learners and Teachers-as-Designers sessions. It integrates an accessible ML learning platform designed for students with limited math and computing skills.

Intelligent manufacturing is the latest form of advanced manufacturing development. In order to pay attention to the design and evaluation status of manufacturing system, we understand the connotation of manufacturing system from the perspective of actual manufacturing production and sales. In this paper, the evaluation model and algorithm of Intelligent Manufacturing System Based on pattern recognition and big data are proposed. In the process of studying the information transmission of intelligent manufacturing system, the evaluation hierarchy algorithm of intelligent control system is improved with reference to several modeling methods. Finally, an intelligent manufacturing system suitable for processing big data is designed. In the experiment in workshop A, with the help of computer simulation of artificial intelligent activities, the intelligent manufacturing system analyzes the processing and production data, obtains the dynamic requirements of products in the machining workshop, and provides judgment basis for the construction of dynamic units in enterprises. The experimental results show that after the change of the production organization model using the seasonal change forecasting method, the introduction of the smart manufacturing system, the sales production of this shop has been increasing, and in the 20th month has increased seven times more than the initial, while the overall situation of the predicted sales and actual sales and costs, the superiority of using the smart manufacturing evaluation model is derived.;"[Guo, Yuan; Qin, Qiang; Zhang, Weitang; Wei, Yun; Li, Wei] Hefei Univ, Sch Adv Mfg Engn, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China";Hefei University;Zhang, WT (corresponding author), Hefei Univ, Sch Adv Mfg Engn, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.;"wushi1979101@163.com; qinqio@hfuu.edu.cn; zhangweitang@hfuu.edu.cn; rainbowlovebaby@163.com; Liwei@hfuu.edu.cn";;;"School Level Talent Fund of Hefei University [20RC12]; Major scientific and technological projects of Anhui Province [201903a05020033]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation [1908085QF270]; Support Program Project for Excellent Youth Talent in Higher Education of Anhui Province [gxyq2020065]";"School Level Talent Fund of Hefei University; Major scientific and technological projects of Anhui Province; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Support Program Project for Excellent Youth Talent in Higher Education of Anhui Province";This research is supported by School Level Talent Fund of Hefei University in 2020 (20RC12), Major scientific and technological projects of Anhui Province (201903a05020033), Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (1908085QF270), the Support Program Project for Excellent Youth Talent in Higher Education of Anhui Province (gxyq2020065).;;25;0;0;18;75;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;APR;2023;27;7;;;;;4195;4208;;10.1007/s00500-022-07030-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-022-07030-x;;APR 2022;14;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;A2TK8;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000780664800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, studies have indicated that most of these assessment systems fail to detect patient emotions when they are assessing their stays in a hospital. This information is vital to understanding most of the patient reviews, which are very complex and convey several emotions per review. Therefore, this study aimed to address the problem of detecting mul-tiple emotions from patient reviews.Methods: First, a large set of patient opinions was collected from a website that allowed patients to publish their experiences when visiting hospitals. Second, each opinion was labeled with the corresponding conveyed emo-tions. Third, a deep learning architecture based on a bidirectional gated recurrent unit with a multichannel convolutional neural network layer was proposed to detect multiple emotions from these reviews. Finally, the hyperparameters of this architecture were fine-tuned and different pretrained word embedding models were configured to test its performance.Results: The results confirmed that our proposed method outperformed other deep learning and machine learning-based algorithms and achieved an average accuracy of 95.82%. Furthermore, the experiments show that clinical-domain word embedding slightly outperforms other general-domain word embeddings, although general-domain embeddings are larger in terms of dimensions.Conclusions: The combination of the gated recurrent unit and the multichannel convolutional neural network is able to exploit both semantic and syntactic characteristics of patient opinions. The findings of this study identify research gaps related to areas such as opinion-based hospital recommendations, thereby providing future research directions.;"[Serrano-Guerrero, Jesus; Bani-Doumi, Mohammad; Romero, Francisco P.; Olivas, Jose A.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Technol & Syst, Escuela Super Informat, Ciudad Real, Spain";Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha;Serrano-Guerrero, J (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Informat Technol & Syst, Escuela Super Informat, Ciudad Real, Spain.;"jesus.serrano@uclm.es; mohammad.fakhri@alu.uclm.es; franciscop.romero@uclm.es; joseangel.olivas@uclm.es";"Serrano-Guerrero, Jesus/A-4137-2013; Bani-Doumi, Mohammad/JOK-0530-2023";"Serrano-Guerrero, Jesus/0000-0002-6177-8188; Bani-Doumi, Mohammad/0000-0002-6355-1753";"FEDER; State Research Agency (AEI) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competition; [PID2019-104735RB-C42]";"FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); State Research Agency (AEI) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competition(Spanish Government);";This work has been partially supported by FEDER and the State Research Agency (AEI) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competition under grant SAFER: PID2019-104735RB-C42 (AEI/FEDER, UE) .;;72;11;12;3;6;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0933-3657;1873-2860;;ARTIF INTELL MED;Artif.

Additionally, as economic resources are generally limited, it is sought to avoid investing large sums of money in software and hardware, as well as in fitting out laboratories. This work presents a didactic proposal within the framework of active and collaborative learning that includes the flipped classroom technique to be applied in the curriculum of undergraduate engineering programs and inside a massive flexible digital master class. The activity is the mathematical modeling, simulation, and control system of a direct current motor where simulation work is carried out in open license computational packages. Students understand the physical phenomena involved in the motor's modeling and the input-output variables' relations. Moreover, an analogy between an electromechanical and a pure electrical model is carried out, where the relevant variables respond in an agile and reliable manner. To validate the modeling, the differential equations are solved by applying numerical methods, and tested for control purposes. The activity has been validated with a rule-based system applied to a Likert scale survey data. This type of human-computer interaction, in the context of active learning, could engage students and motivate them to develop competencies that are highly appreciated by industry practitioners.;"[Said, Alejandro; Ramirez-Mendoza, Ricardo A.] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Felix-Herran, Luis C.] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Blvd Enrique Mazon Lopez 965, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico; [Davizon, Yasser A.] Univ Politecn Mar & Sierra, Dept Informat Technol, Potrerillos Del Norote 82740, Tayoltita, Mexico; [Hernandez-Santos, Carlos] Tecnol Nacl Mexico IT Nuevo Leon, Av Eloy Cavazos 2001, Guadalupe 67170, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Soto, Rogelio] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, 1 West Univ Blvd, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA";"Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley";Félix-Herrán, LC (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Blvd Enrique Mazon Lopez 965, Hermosillo 83000, Sonora, Mexico.;"al.rodriguez.phd.mty@tec.mx; lcfelix@tec.mx; ydavizon@upmys.edu.mx; carlos.hernandez@itnl.edu.mx; rogelio.soto@utrgv.edu; ricardo.ramirez@tec.mx";"ramirez, ricardo/HJA-2728-2022; Ramirez-Mendoza, Ricardo A./I-4584-2015";"Ramirez-Mendoza, Ricardo A./0000-0002-5122-507X; Hernandez, Carlos/0000-0002-9334-1159; Davizon, Yasser A./0000-0003-3527-9040; Said, Alejandro/0000-0003-4925-5189";"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT); Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico";"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico";This work has been supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT), and Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico.;;46;2;2;2;9;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;APR;2022;11;7;;;;;;;1059;10.3390/electronics11071059;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11071059;;;25;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";0L2SO;;gold, Green Published;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000781329900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

J;Wang, J;;;;Wang, Jing;;;Rule Analysis of Teaching Evaluation System Based on Data Mining under Web Platform;SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;VISUALIZATION;In order to understand the advantages of the teaching evaluation system to teachers and students more intuitively, according to the data analysis, the lowest total score of teachers is -> 1.04, and the five index values are all negative, so the relevant teaching contents should be changed according to the index factors of relevant teaching evaluation to make it easier for students to understand and accept. Through the analysis of the total evaluation scores of several teachers surveyed in each semester, we can see that the total evaluation scores of teachers 4 and 7 fluctuate greatly, so we should choose suitable teaching content for rectification. By classifying teachers, they are divided into three categories by means of discipline colleges, etc. It can be seen from the figure that the lowest total score of teachers in category 3 is -> 2.12, which shows that teachers in this category may have similar problems in teaching methods. By comparing the information entropy algorithm of teaching evaluation, we know that the information entropy under the AVF algorithm model takes about 1 ms to the teaching evaluation algorithm, while the greedy algorithm model takes about 20 ms to test the teaching evaluation system. We know that the teaching evaluation system based on the proposed algorithm information entropy algorithm and the teaching evaluation system under the AVF algorithm model and traditional information entropy all pass the test. However, combined with the images, the AVF algorithm model has the highest computational efficiency and the shortest time, followed by the proposed algorithm model. Compared with the traditional teaching evaluation algorithm, it is inefficient and takes a long time. When the number of requests is 1000, the average response time of the AVF algorithm method is 17 ms, and the longest time of the traditional method is 32 ms. Combined with images, when the number of requests is 1000, 1500, 200, 2500, 3000, 350, and 4000, the average response time increases with the increase of the number of requests, but the AVF algorithm method takes the shortest time and meets most teaching evaluation requirements. Combined with the success rate image, we can see that the success rate decreases slightly with the increase of request times, but the success rate of the AVF algorithm method is relatively stable, with the lowest of 99.6% when the request times are 3500. Through a large number of charts and analyses, we can see that the teaching evaluation under the AVF algorithm method has the highest efficiency and the shortest time.;[Wang, Jing] Southwest Unicers, Fac Educ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China;;Wang, J (corresponding author), Southwest Unicers, Fac Educ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.;wj6002@swu.edu.cn;;Wang, Jing/0000-0001-8293-6723;Chongqing Social Science General Project [2019 YBJJ114.\\S1HCIFS01\DEMData\ 16955\ MYFILES\ HINDAWI\SP\ 7133380\ PROOF\COPYEDITING\gs1];Chongqing Social Science General Project;This work was sponsored in part by Chongqing Social Science General Project, no.2019 YBJJ114.\\S1HCIFS01\DEMData\ 16955\ MYFILES\ HINDAWI\SP\ 7133380\ PROOF\COPYEDITING\gs1;;24;0;0;0;5;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1058-9244;1875-919X;;SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH;Sci.

Recently, significant advancements have been made for experimental instruments that are related to The Principles of Computer Composition for colleges in terms of their functions and performances. However, most instruments are old, prone to failure, and are rarely automated. Some experimental systems use field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or a complex programming logic device (CPLD); however, the systems still use numerous integrated discrete and small-scale chips, which limits the functionalities of FPGA or CPLD chips. It is difficult to reconfigure the logic in all aspects of the experiment, and only a limited part of the logic can be reconstructed. Meanwhile, simulation experiments alone are too abstract for students to intuitively understand the circuit structures of the hardware. To address these issues, a CPLD-based experiment system for the course The Principles of Computer Composition was designed. The proposed system has a flexible design with clear circuit structures and a high degree of automation and stability. In addition, it comes with multiple functions, including logic reconstruction.

J;Belitz, C;;;;Belitz, Clara;;;Constructing categories: Moving beyond protected classes in algorithmic fairness;JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Automated, data-driven decision making is increasingly common in a variety of application domains. In educational software, for example, machine learning has been applied to tasks like selecting the next exercise for students to complete. Machine learning methods, however, are not always equally effective for all groups of students. Current approaches to designing fair algorithms tend to focus on statistical measures concerning a small subset of legally protected categories like race or gender. Focusing solely on legally protected categories, however, can limit our understanding of bias and unfairness by ignoring the complexities of identity. We propose an alternative approach to categorization, grounded in sociological techniques of measuring identity. By soliciting survey data and interviews from the population being studied, we can build context-specific categories from the bottom up. The emergent categories can then be combined with extant algorithmic fairness strategies to discover which identity groups are not well-served, and thus where algorithms should be improved or avoided altogether. We focus on educational applications but present arguments that this approach should be adopted more broadly for issues of algorithmic fairness across a variety of applications.;"Univ Illinois, Sch Informat Sci, Champaign, IL USA; Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Carnegie Learning Inc, Pittsburgh, PA USA";"University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Pennsylvania";Belitz, C (corresponding author), Sch Informat Sci, 501 E Daniel St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.;cbelitz2@illinos.edu;;"Ritter, Steve/0000-0003-2807-9390; Fancsali, Stephen/0000-0002-4016-8145; Belitz, Clara/0009-0002-1960-0914";"National Science Foundation [2000638]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Directorate for STEM Education [2000638] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";"National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Directorate for STEM Education(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))";National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2000638;;39;4;4;2;18;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2330-1635;2330-1643;;J ASSOC INF SCI TECH;;JUN;2023;74;6;;;;;663;668;;10.1002/asi.24643;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.24643;;MAR 2022;6;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science";F3UV2;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000770337500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Students of various cognitive and psychological abilities participate in the learning process. However, most students are hesitant to provide regular and honest feedback on the comprehensiveness of the course, making it difficult for the instructor to ensure that all students are grasping the information at the same rate. The students' understanding of the course and their emotional engagement, as indicated via facial expressions, are intertwined. This paper attempts to present a three-dimensional DenseNet self-attention neural network (DenseAttNet) used to identify and evaluate student participation in modern and traditional educational programs. With the Dataset for Affective States in E-Environments (DAiSEE), the proposed DenseAttNet model outperformed all other existing methods, achieving baseline accuracy of 63.59% for engagement classification and 54.27% for boredom classification, respectively.

As modern education has been implemented, the educational level of both students and teachers has improved. This advancement is made possible by increased knowledge of how to use mobile technology with the Internet. In this study, a multiprocessor learning-based CNN algorithm is proposed to improve students' English language speaking fluency. Additionally, the students and the teachers are considered available in the remote area, and the communication between them is done through an interactive system. The model is designed to focus on a teacher-centric perspective, in which the teacher has to make use of multiple resources or applications to perform an easier understanding of the course for the students. Hence, an intelligent system is designed to make the learning processes successful. The results show that the proposed algorithm works well in improving the teaching efficiency of mobile English learning. It also revealed that the accuracy level of the learning system used by college and university students has increased by 10%.;"[Ji, Dandan; Yang, Xuming; Wang, Weifeng] Changchun Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Languages, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China";Jilin University of Finance & Economics;Ji, DD (corresponding author), Changchun Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Foreign Languages, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.;fls2021@ccufe.edu.cn;;;Higher Education Research Project of Jilin Province Higher Education Association [JGJX2020D560, JGJX2021D530];Higher Education Research Project of Jilin Province Higher Education Association;This study was supported by the Higher Education Research Project of Jilin Province Higher Education Association administered by the Jilin Provincial Higher Education Association in 2020: On Research and Application of Competence-Oriented Modern College English Online Course (no.

J;"Wang, ZF; Wang, JH";;;;"Wang, Zhengfa; Wang, Junheng";;;Analysis of Emotional Education Infiltration in College Physical Education Based on Emotional Feature Clustering;WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Integration of emotional education physical education research in colleges and universities is a topic that has both theoretical and practical implications. Teachers in physical education should pay attention not only to the development of students' physical knowledge and skills but also to their emotional education, emphasizing the positive role of emotional factors. Emotion is a type of internal experience that people have when deciding whether or not objective things can meet their needs. The diversity of emotional needs, the contradiction of emotional experience, the singleness of emotional orientation, and the universality of negative emotions are all new characteristics of contemporary college students' emotional development. A teaching feedback strategy generation algorithm based on the emotional learning ontology is designed to obtain the students' perception and understanding of the learning process without the need for question-and-answer interaction with the students. Based on emotional triggers, a better understanding of students' learning status can be provided, as well as better cognitive and emotional support. The main measure and means to improve teaching quality and efficiency in physical education is to combine cognition, emotion, and education. This paper discusses the connotation and scope of emotional education in colleges and universities and proposes ideas for strengthening emotional education in colleges and universities in light of the new characteristics of college students' emotional development, based on the clustering of emotional features, in terms of emphasizing the emotional influence of teachers, bolstering students' aesthetic education, and exploring new avenues for college students' emotional education.;"[Wang, Zhengfa] Anhui Vocat & Tech Coll Commerce, Dept Phys Educ, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junheng] Anhui Normal Univ, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China";Anhui Normal University;Wang, JH (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.;2006800102@hfut.edu.cn;;;"Humanities and Social Science Research Project of Anhui Universities [SK2019A0521]; Quality Project of Anhui Province [2020xsxxkc173]";"Humanities and Social Science Research Project of Anhui Universities; Quality Project of Anhui Province";This study was supported by the Humanities and Social Science Research Project of Anhui Universities (SK2019A0521) and Quality Project of Anhui Province (2020xsxxkc173).;;30;0;0;5;54;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

Football is a relatively common sport in HVC with a certain degree of regularity and difficulty. Therefore, how to improve the level and the quality of teaching through scientific and reasonable teaching methods has become one of the problems that need to be solved in HVC. This article mainly focuses on the analysis and research of the traditional teaching mode and students' learning situation based on the intelligent algorithm and puts forward effective improvement suggestions and strategies for reference. This article uses questionnaire surveys and data analysis methods to understand the evaluation results of the school's teachers and students on the teaching quality (TQ) of the football course and the necessity of implementing improvement strategies through questionnaire surveys. According to the survey results, most of the interviewees had a high evaluation of the TQ of the school's football course. 46 of the teachers and students who participated in the evaluation rated the school's football course teaching methods as excellent, and only 2 rated it as passing.

The contribution of the educational robotics in demystifying new scientific fields for K-12 students is remarkable, but things become more challenging when trying to discover efficient practices for higher education. Indeed, there is an apparent need for pilot examples facilitating students' professional skills acquisition and thus matching the potential of the actual systems used in the modern agricultural premises. In this regard, this work discuses laboratory experiences while implementing an automatic airflow control system of convincing size and role capable for remote configuration and monitoring. This non-conventional robotic example exploits retired electromechanical equipment, from an old farm, and revives it using modern widely available microcontrollers, smart phones/tablets, network transceivers, motor drivers, and some cheap and/or custom sensors. The contribution of the corresponding software parts to this transformation is of crucial importance for the success of the whole system. Thankfully, these parts are implemented using easy-to-use programming tools, of open and free nature at most, that are suitable for the pairing credit-card-sized computer systems. The proposed solution is exhibiting modularity and scalability and assists students and future professionals to better understand the role of key elements participating in the digital transformation of the agricultural sector.

It is difficult to achieve good performance with a single feature classification model. In order to balance the large-scale information and global features of images, a robust dictionary learning method based on image multi-vector representation is proposed in this paper. First, this proposed method generates a reasonable virtual image for the original image and obtains the multi-vector representation of all images. Second, the same dictionary learning algorithm is used for each vector representation to obtain multiple sets of image features. The proposed multi-vector representation can provide a good global understanding of the whole image contour and increase the content of dictionary learning. Last, the weighted fusion algorithm is used to classify the test samples. The introduction of influencing factors and the automatic adjustment of the weights of each classifier in the final decision results have a significant indigenous effect on better extracting image features. The study conducted experiments on the proposed algorithm on a number of widely used image databases. A large number of experimental results show that it effectively improves the accuracy of image classification. At the same time, to fully dig and exploit possible representation diversity might be a better way to lead to potential various appearances and high classification accuracy concerning the image.;"[Pan, Chengchang; Zhang, Yongjun; Wang, Zewei] Guizhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Key Lab Intelligent Med Image Anal & Precise Diag, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Cui, Zhongwei] Guizhou Educ Univ, Sch Math & Big Data, Guiyang 550018, Peoples R China; [Cui, Zhongwei] Guizhou Educ Univ, Big Data Sci & Intelligent Engn Res Inst, Guiyang 550018, Peoples R China";"Guizhou University; Guizhou Education University; Guizhou Education University";Zhang, YJ (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Key Lab Intelligent Med Image Anal & Precise Diag, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China.;"gzpan19@hotmail.com; yjzhang1@gzu.edu.cn; gs.wangzw19@gzu.edu.cn; zhongweicui@gznc.edu.cn";"Zhang, Yongjun/M-1094-2013; Pan, Cheng-Chang/AAC-6346-2021";wang, zewei/0000-0001-8805-0755;"Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Guizhou University [49]; Key Disciplines of Guizhou Province Computer Science and Technology [ZDXK[2018]007]; Research Projects of Innovation Group of Education [[2021]022]; Guizhou Province Graduate Research Fund [YJSCXJH[2020]53, YJSCXJH[2020]189]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62062023]";"Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Guizhou University; Key Disciplines of Guizhou Province Computer Science and Technology; Research Projects of Innovation Group of Education; Guizhou Province Graduate Research Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))";This work was supported by the Research Foundation for Advanced Talents of Guizhou University under Grant: (2016) No. 49, Key Disciplines of Guizhou Province Computer Science and Technology (ZDXK[2018]007), Research Projects of Innovation Group of Education (QianJiaoHeKY[2021]022), Project supported by the Guizhou Province Graduate Research Fund (YJSCXJH[2020]53, YJSCXJH[2020]189), and supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62062023).;;39;0;0;1;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;MAR;2022;11;6;;;;;;;847;10.3390/electronics11060847;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11060847;;;19;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";0C8WX;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000775588200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) aims to understand, design, and evaluate robotic systems intended for human use. Robots and humans must communicate for interaction to occur. Human-robot communication can take various forms, but the proximity of the two parties heavily influences these forms.HRI innovations entail learning, designing, and evaluating robotics systems that communicate with people. Robots connecting and speaking with humans are becoming increasingly common at home, customer service, education, and healthcare. Despite the fact that there are now many robotic instruments that teach students how to learn various subjects and activities, efficient integration of the prediction model is still under development. Therefore, this research introduces a student engagement prediction model using HRI (SEPM-HRI) in higher education. This model uses the supervised learning algorithm for student engagement prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed model can implement in a real-time scenario with the expected prediction accuracy of 98.78%. The experimental results show that the proposed SEPM-HRImodel enhances an accuracy ratio of 98.78%, interaction ratio of 95.62%, prediction ratio of 96.35%, a learning rate of 94.26%, a student engagement ratio of 93.14%, and a student participation ratio of 92.86%.

However, there is no unified standard to effectively measure the cultivation effect. The current performance inference method cannot comprehensively evaluate the scientific research ability of college students. Few scholars have directly analyzed the college students' scientific research ability from the internal and external influencing factors. Therefore, this paper tries to design and implement a neural network analysis system for scientific research ability evaluation of college students. After surveying the status quo of scientific research ability evaluation of college students in northern China's Hebei Province, a hierarchical evaluation index system was constructed for college students' scientific research ability, referring to the existing evaluation index systems, and the weights were designed for the evaluation indices. Next, the backpropagation (BP) neural network was optimized by chaotic sine-cosine grasshopper optimization algorithm (CSCGOA) and used to establish a neural network analysis system for scientific research ability evaluation of college students. The proposed system was proved effective through experiments. The relevant results effectively enhance the scientific level and accuracy of the evaluation of college students' scientific research ability, improve the cultivation of college students, and provide a scientific basis for colleges to understand the scientific research ability of their students.;"[Yin, Huilan; Qi, Yanming] Hebei Univ Engn, Sch Humanities & Law, Handan 056038, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jing] Hebei Univ Engn, Educ Technol Ctr, Handan 056038, Peoples R China; [Li, Dongping] Hebei Univ Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Handan 056038, Peoples R China";"Hebei University of Engineering; Hebei University of Engineering; Hebei University of Engineering";Qi, YM (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Engn, Sch Humanities & Law, Handan 056038, Peoples R China.;qiyanming@hebeu.edu.cn;;;Hebei Social Science Foundation Project [HE21MK032];Hebei Social Science Foundation Project;The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Hebei Social Science Foundation Project (HE21MK032).;;28;0;0;14;69;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1058-9244;1875-919X;;SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH;Sci.

By examining this relationship, the authors aim to expand the theoretical domain of gratitude research by examining its potential influence on technology-induced stress. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey was used to collect and analyze data from 552 Indian college students who participated in graduate and postgraduate programs across various educational institutions in India. Regression and mediation analyses were performed with both IBM SPSS 25 and AMOS. Findings This study's data suggest that positive reframing plays an important mediating role between gratitude and technostress. Gratitude also encourages positive reframing, which reduced technostress among the students. Taken together, our data showed that gratitude induces positive reframing, which in turn reduces techno-stress among Indian students in the current study. Research limitations/implications The sample size in this study is relatively small in relation to the student population in India. The current study relied primarily on quantitative data and analysis and further research could use a mixed-method approach to better understand the underlying mechanisms between positive reframing, gratitude and technostress. The results are derived under an extreme coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to normal times. Practical implications The paper includes implications for teachers, academic leaders, parents and civil society. Originality/value Overall, the relationship between positive reframing, gratitude and technostress has not been thoroughly explored. To the best of the authors' understanding, this is the first study to examine the influence of gratitude on technology-induced stress and the role of reframing.";"[Garg, Naval; Verma, Shivangi] Delhi Technol Univ, Univ Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Delhi, India; [Palframan, Jason Timothy] Technol Univ Shannon Midlands Midwest, Fac Business & Hospitality, Athlone Campus, Athlone, Ireland";Delhi Technological University;Palframan, JT (corresponding author), Technol Univ Shannon Midlands Midwest, Fac Business & Hospitality, Athlone Campus, Athlone, Ireland.;jason.palframan@tus.ie;"Palframan, Jason/P-7937-2019; Verma, Shivangi/AFR-6180-2022";"Palframan, Jason/0000-0002-8602-5182; Verma, Shivangi/0000-0002-9023-2635; GARG, NAVAL/0000-0001-6694-9663";;;;;74;8;8;5;25;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0368-492X;1758-7883;;KYBERNETES;Kybernetes;AUG 3;2023;52;8;;;;;2810;2825;;10.1108/K-12-2021-1250;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-12-2021-1250;;FEB 2022;16;Computer Science, Cybernetics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;O2EK9;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000759698700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methodology: Our proposed algorithm characterizes the trajectory integral associated with vorticity deviation and the spatial mean of vortex rings, for the Lagrangian averaged vorticity deviation (LAVD) based identification and tracking of vortex rings within the heart chamber. For this purpose, the optical flow concept was adopted to interpolate the time frames between larger discrete frames, to minimize the error caused by constructing a continuous velocity field for the integral process of LAVD. Then the Hough transform was used to automatically extract the vortex regions of interest. The computed flow data within the RA of the participants' hearts was then used to validate the performance of our proposed method. Results: In the paper, illustrations are provided for derived evolution of Euler vortices and Lagrangian vortices of a healthy subject. The visualization results have shown that our proposed method can accurately identify the Euler vortices and Lagrangian vortices, in the context of measuring the vorticity and vortex volume of the vortices within the RA chamber. Then the employment of Hough transform-based automated vortex extraction has improved the robustness and scalability of the LAVD in identifying cardiac vortices. The analytical results have demonstrated that the introduction of the Horn-Schunck optical flow can more accurately synthesize the intermediate PC-MRI to construct a continuous velocity field, compared with other interpolation methods. Conclusion: A novel analytical framework has been developed to accurately identify the flow vortices in the RA chamber based on Horn-Schunck optical flow and Hough transform. From the obtained analytical study results, the development and changes of dominant vortices within this cardiac chamber during the cardiac cycle can be acquired. This can provide to cardiologists a deeper understanding of the hemodynamics within the heart chambers. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre-and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students' CT.";"[Zhao, Li; Liu, Xiaohong; Wang, Chenhui] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Su, Yu-Sheng] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Keelung, Taiwan";"Nanjing Normal University; National Taiwan Ocean University";Su, YS (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Keelung, Taiwan.;ntouaddisonsu@gmail.com;"Su, Yu-Sheng/ABD-3489-2020; Liu, Xiaohong/GPT-2446-2022";"Su, Yu-Sheng/0000-0002-1531-3363; Liu, Xiaohong/0000-0003-4931-8370; Zhao, Li/0000-0003-1000-1296";"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 109-2511-H-019-004-MY2]; Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (CN) [19JYB017]";"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (CN)";This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under grant MOST 109-2511-H-019-004-MY2, and Philosophy and Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (CN), (No.19JYB017).;;110;29;30;28;201;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

First, the existing issues of students' chemistry learning and knowledge systems are analyzed. Then, a personalized learning model is constructed based on the distributed computing method of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the clustering algorithm of deep learning (DL). This model realizes the effective classification of students by the DL algorithm according to the students' learning data and designs diverse customized teaching contents in line with the performance of IoT. Finally, this model's effectiveness is verified through the data analysis of 2019 chemistry students at M University. The research results indicate that 96.67% of students express satisfaction with the learning effect of the personalized learning model, and 100% of learners are satisfied with the various forms of teaching resources offered by this model. Besides, this model's accuracy can reach 85% on the personalized learning platform based on IoT and DL algorithms. Compared with the latest research model, this model has a better performance in achievement prediction and customized recommendation. The test results of the actual effect demonstrate that the personalized learning system has achieved expected outcomes, significantly enhancing students' understanding of knowledge with medium difficulty. In addition, learners are delighted with the model. They believe that the learning resources in the model can meet their learning needs, and they are willing to recommend the course to other learners actively. This model is of significant practical value to promote the development of IoT and DL technology in professional learning.

In addition, it presents potential approaches to overcome the obstacles to implementing strategies with this group of students. The research employed a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews as a data collection tool and applied a thematic analysis. The study population comprised 35 teachers of students with intellectual disabilities and the study sample numbered six teachers. The interviews were conducted via different methods: three by phone, two face-to face, and one using the Zoom platfoun. The results revealed inadequate understanding among teachers of intellectual disability and behaviour modification strategies, and this affected their capacity to develop plans that were compatible with the needs of students with intellectual disability. The findings also identified multiple obstacles that impede teachers' implementation of strategies to modify aggressive behaviour among students with intellectual disabilities; the most important being the lack of input from a psychological specialist when developing programs to modify aggressive behaviour. In general, it is apparent that programs for modifying aggressive behaviour are neither structured nor complementary, due to the scarcity of administrators with sufficient knowledge and familiarity with the characteristics and personalities of students with intellectual disabilities. This study presents several recommendations, the most important of which is that teachers of students with intellectual disability should develop themselves through training courses to enable them to deal with these students and create treatment plans that include strategies and clear steps to modify the aggressive behaviour of students with intellectual disabilities. To support teachers, it is also necessary to remove the obstacles facing education centres by providing financial support to create an environment in which they can access the required devices and equipment in their classes.";"[Alqurashi, Yasser O.; Bagadood, Nizar H.] Umm Al Qura Univ, Fac Educ, Mecca, Saudi Arabia";Umm Al Qura University;Alqurashi, YO (corresponding author), Umm Al Qura Univ, Fac Educ, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.;;"Bagadood, Nizar H./AFM-8578-2022; BAGADOOD, NIZAR H./GQI-0194-2022";"Bagadood, Nizar H./0000-0002-8629-5297; BAGADOOD, NIZAR H./0000-0002-8629-5297";;;;;15;0;0;0;2;INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS;SEOUL;DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA;1738-7906;;;INT J COMPUT SCI NET;Int.

Through the investigation of network security managers, this article uses structured modeling technology to derive the system's logical business functions, which are data acquisition function, data analysis function, and post-processing function. This study uses a three-tier architecture to design the system, describes the system data business processing flow, and gives the key flow of the K-means algorithm application. In addition, the system database is designed to provide support for system data processing. This study proposes a dual-network text matching model based on local interactive components. This model composes two modalities of single-modal short text data: a positional structural modal for describing local interactions and a global semantic understanding modal for extracting global semantic information. Two heterogeneous networks are used to extract two modalities. The principle of complementarity of modalities is realized by constructing the differences of each modal. At the same time, through the attention mechanism, the position information of the position structure modal is transferred to the global semantic understanding modal to obtain consistent comprehensive information so as to realize the principle of modal consistency. On this basis, by designing low-order interaction functions and high-order interaction functions, and using long- and short-term memory networks, we have, respectively, improved the position structure modal and global semantic understanding modal. The theoretical analysis and simulation results of the model show that the propagation characteristics of the network worm are completely determined by the threshold R0 required for its existence. When R0 >1, the network worm will become popular even with a small initial infection number; conversely, even if the initial infection machine is large, the network worm will eventually become extinct. The research results of this article also show that the introduction of mobile devices has an important impact on the defense technology of network worms. To curb network worms that use both the network and mobile devices to spread, and to increase the proportion of machines that have never been infected with the virus, the most effective method is to control the number of mobile devices and reduce the possibility of cross-infection between mobile devices and machines. The simulation results show that, regardless of whether dynamic isolation and antivirus software are considered, the local area network-based choke method given in this study can effectively curb intelligent network worms that have slow scanning rates and clear scanning targets. In addition, the choke method presented in this article can determine the choke threshold without affecting the normal network scanning behavior of users in the local area network.";"[Hou, Jinhuan] Shandong Univ Engn & Vocat Technol, Dept Informat Engn, Qingdao 250200, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ding, Fuqiang] Shandong Univ Engn & Vocat Technol, Assets & Equipment Management Off, Qingdao 250200, Shandong, Peoples R China";;Hou, JH (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Engn & Vocat Technol, Dept Informat Engn, Qingdao 250200, Shandong, Peoples R China.;"hjh0519@suet.edu.cn; dfq0225@126.com";;;;;;;26;0;0;0;9;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1058-9244;1875-919X;;SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH;Sci.

In this study, we propose a discrete data modeling algorithm for smart interactive English teaching based on discrete data points and normal vectors using B splines. By adding normal vector constraints, this method can maintain good fitting results even when the data points are discrete. The method consists of four parts, namely, discrete point parameterization, B-spline dominant point selection, node vector determination, and least-squares fitting, including both data point error and normal vector error. The mobile APP-based initial intelligent interactive English teaching should adhere to the four principles of autonomy of English course learning, adhere to teacher dominance in the language classroom, grasp the humanistic nature of English course content, and focus on the practical nature of English course implementation. The interactive learning environment based on mobile APP can promote students' in-depth understanding of knowledge. The higher the student's interest in learning, the deeper the degree of understanding; the more diverse the learning methods, the more it can promote students' in-depth understanding of knowledge; the stronger the degree of interaction, the higher the level of understanding.

Students are good at understanding natural language questions and based on their domain knowledge can easily infer the question's answer by connecting the dots across various pertinent facts. Considering automated reasoning for elementary science question answering, we address the novel task of generating explanations for answers from human-authored facts. For this, we examine the practically scalable framework of feature-rich support vector machines leveraging domain-targeted, hand-crafted features. Explanations are created from a human-annotated set of nearly 5000 candidate facts in the WorldTree corpus. Our aim is to obtain better matches for valid facts of an explanation for the correct answer of a question over the available fact candidates. To this end, our features offer a comprehensive linguistic and semantic unification paradigm. The machine learning problem is the preference ordering of facts, for which we test pointwise regression versus pairwise learning-to-rank. Our contributions, originating from comprehensive evaluations against nine existing systems, are (1) a case study in which two preference ordering approaches are systematically compared, and where the pointwise approach is shown to outperform the pairwise approach, thus adding to the existing survey of observations on this topic; (2) since our system outperforms a highly-effective TF-IDF-based IR technique by 3.5 and 4.9 points on the development and test sets, respectively, it demonstrates some of the further task improvement possibilities (e.g., in terms of an efficient learning algorithm, semantic features) on this task; (3) it is a practically competent approach that can outperform some variants of BERT-based reranking models; and (4) the human-engineered features make it an interpretable machine learning model for the task.";"[D'Souza, Jennifer; Auer, Soren] TIB Leibniz Informat Ctr Sci & Technol, Hannover, Germany; [Mulang, Isaiah Onando] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany";University of Bonn;D'Souza, J (corresponding author), TIB Leibniz Informat Ctr Sci & Technol, Hannover, Germany.;jennifer.dsouza@tib.eu;;"D'Souza, Jennifer/0000-0002-6616-9509; Auer, Soren/0000-0002-0698-2864";;;;;40;0;0;0;6;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND;1351-3249;1469-8110;;NAT LANG ENG;Nat.

J;"Swai, CT; Mangowi, SE";;;;"Swai, Carina Titus; Mangowi, Steven Edward";;;Mining school teachers' MOOC training responses to infer their face-to-face teaching strategy preference;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Teaching strategy; Classification; Educational data mining; Visualization; And model evaluation";;Purpose The general goal of this paper is to help educators understand the importance of MOOC training to school teachers and their hypothetical value for predicting the use of teaching strategies in the face-to face-classroom teaching. With this purpose, the study is guided by two research questions: (1) Are there different patterns of preferences in teaching strategies among school teachers when they participate in MOOC training? (2) To what extent the attributes selected from the data set to visualize patterns are suitable for the formation of models? Design/methodology/approach Peer instruction (PI) and think-pair-share (TPS) strategies might bring positive outcome during classroom teaching. When introduced properly to school teachers, these strategies help students see reason beyond the answers by sharing with other students their response and thus learning from each other. This study aims to use educational data mining (EDM) techniques to visualize patterns and propose models based on the teaching strategies training to be used in face-to-face classroom teaching. The data set includes five attributes extracted from school teachers' Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) training interaction data. All analysis and visualization were performed using Python, and the models were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. The modeling performance of three different algorithms (decision tree, random forest and K-means) was tested on the data set. The results of model accuracy were presented as a confusion matrix. The experimental results indicate that the random forest (RF) algorithm outperforms decision tree (DT) and K-means algorithms with an accuracy of 96.4%. Findings This visualization information on the grouping of school teachers based on the teaching strategies serves as an essential reference for school teachers choosing between the two types of strategies within their face-to-face classroom settings. Teachers may use the finding obtained for an initial understanding of which strategies will fit well on their classroom teaching based on their subject majors. Moreover, the classification accuracy rates of DT and RF algorithms were the highest and considered highly significant to allow developing predictive models for similar EDM cases and provide a positive effect on the learning environment. Research limitations/implications This visualization information on the grouping of school teachers based on the teaching strategies serves as an essential reference for school teachers choosing between the two types of strategies within their face-to-face classroom settings. Teachers may use the finding obtained for an initial understanding of which strategies will fit well on their classroom teaching based on their subject majors. Unlike predicting different patterns of preferences in teaching strategies among school teachers when they participate in MOOC training, using visualization was found much more comfortable, less complicated and more time-efficient for small data sets. Moreover, the classification accuracy rates of decision tree and random forest algorithms were the highest and considered highly significant to allow developing predictive models for similar educational data mining cases and provide a positive effect on the learning environment. Practical implications DT classifier in this study ranks first before model optimization, but second after model optimization in terms of accuracy. Therefore, the goodness of the indicators needs to be further studied to devise a reasonable intervention. Social implications A different group of school teachers attending training on teaching strategies in a different online platform is required in future research to cross-validate these study findings.

J;"Wu, WN; Deng, ZH";;;;"Wu, WenNing; Deng, ZhengHong";;;The Analysis of Public Opinion in Colleges and Universities Oriented to Wireless Networks under the Application of Intelligent Data Mining;WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;In recent years, the incidence of public opinion in colleges and universities has been high. Monitoring, forecasting, and responding to public opinion of students in colleges and universities have increasingly become the work that education management departments at all levels attach great importance to. For each university, how to understand the sensation of teachers and students in real time in the era of informationization entering the intelligent campus has become an urgent problem. How to collect college campus network information, analyze and manage this information, and find hot topics from it has a profound impact on the reform of colleges and universities. Hence, in this paper, we propose a public opinion analysis framework based on intelligent data mining technique. Its advantage lies in the fact that it can withdraw the needed and unknown knowledge and regularities from the massive network data and host log data. It is a new attempt to use data mining in achieving public opinion. At present, data mining algorithm applied to public opinion analysis mainly has four basic patterns: association, sequence, classification, and clustering. Data mining technology is advanced for: it can process large amount of data. It does not need the users' subjective evaluation and is more likely to discover the ignored and hidden information. Here, initially, the dataset is collected, which is preprocessed and divided into a training set and test set. Feature extraction of the text is done using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). After that, text cosine similarity calculation is performed to compute the similarity between text vectors obtained from the LDA. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for classification purpose. We proposed Krill Herd Harmony Search Optimization Algorithm (KHHSOA) for optimizing the CNN and classifying the text into positive and negative opinion. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB simulation tool, and the performance is analyzed in terms of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, kappa coefficient, and error rate. The proposed method is proved to be better when compared with the existing techniques.;"[Wu, WenNing] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Int Cooperat Dept Sch Cybersecur, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Deng, ZhengHong] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat Sch Cybersecur, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China";"Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University";Wu, WN (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Int Cooperat Dept Sch Cybersecur, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;"wuwenning@nwpu.edu.cn; dthree@nwpu.edu.cn";;;;;;;25;3;3;9;24;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

With the growing relevance of computational thinking, these two efforts have become more closely connected. This survey examines these connections and points to the need for educating the general public to understand the challenges which the increasing integration of AI in human lives pose. We describe three different framings of computational thinking: cognitive, situated, and critical. Each framing offers valuable, but different insights into what computational thinking can and should be. The differences between the three framings also concern the views of learning that they embody. We combine the three framings into one framework which emphasizes that (1) computational thinking activities involve engagement with algorithmic processes, and (2) the mere use of a digital artifact for an activity is not sufficient to count as computational thinking. We further present a set of approaches to learning computational thinking. We argue for the significance of computational thinking as regards artificial intelligence on three counts: (i) Human developers use computational thinking to create and develop artificial intelligence systems, (ii) understanding how humans learn can enrich artificial intelligence systems, and (iii) such enriched systems will be explainable.

J;"Gibney, D; Thankachan, SV";;;;"Gibney, Daniel; Thankachan, Sharma, V";;;On the Complexity of Recognizing Wheeler Graphs;ALGORITHMICA;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Wheeler graphs; FM-index; Burrows-Wheeler transform";"DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS; QUEUE LAYOUTS; EXTENSION; STACK";"In recent years, several compressed indexes based on variants of the Burrows-Wheeler transform have been introduced. Some of these are used to index structures far more complex than a single string, as was originally done with the FM-index (Ferragina and Manzini in J. ACM 52(4):552-581, https://doi.org/10.1145/1082036.1082039, 2005). As such, there has been an increasing effort to better understand under which conditions such an indexing scheme is possible. This has led to the introduction of Wheeler graphs (Gagie et al. in Theor Comput Sci 698:67-78, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2017.06.016, 2017). Gagie et al. showed that de Bruijn graphs, generalized compressed suffix arrays, and several other BWT related structures can be represented as Wheeler graphs, and that Wheeler graphs can be indexed in a space-efficient way. Hence, being able to recognize whether a given graph is a Wheeler graph, or being able to approximate a given graph by a Wheeler graph, could have numerous applications in indexing. Here we resolve the open question of whether there exists an efficient algorithm for recognizing if a given graph is a Wheeler graph. We show: - The problem of recognizing whether a given graph G = (V, E) is a Wheeler graph is NP-complete for any edge label alphabet of size sigma >= 2, even when G is a DAG. This holds even on a restricted subset of graphs called d-NFAs for d >= 5. This is in contrast to recent results demonstrating the problem can be solved in polynomial time for d-NFAs where d <= 2. We also show that the recognition problem can be solved in linear time for sigma = 1 on graphs without self-loops; - There exists an 2(e log sigma+O(n+e)) time exact algorithm where n = vertical bar V vertical bar and e = vertical bar E vertical bar. This algorithm relies on graph isomorphism being computable in strictly sub-exponential time; - We define an optimization variant of the problem called Wheeler Graph Violation, abbreviated WGV, where the aim is to identify the smallest set of edges that have to be removed from a graph to obtain a Wheeler graph. We show WGV is APX-hard, even when G is a DAG, implying there exists a constant C > 1 for which there is no C-approximation algorithm (unless P = NP). Also, conditioned on the Unique Games Conjecture, for all C > 1, it is NP-hard to find a C-approximation, implying WGV is not in APX; - We define the Wheeler Subgraph problem, abbreviated WS, where the aim is to find the largest subgraph which is a Wheeler Graph (the dual of WGV). In contrast to WGV, we give an O(sigma)-approximation algorithm for the WS problem, implying it is in APX for sigma = O(1). The above findings suggest that most problems under this theme are computationally difficult. However, we identify a class of graphs for which the recognition problem is polynomial-time solvable, raising the question of which properties determine this problem's difficulty.";"[Gibney, Daniel] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Computat Sci & Engn, CODA Tech Sq,756 West Peachtree St NW,12th Fl, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Thankachan, Sharma, V] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Comp Sci, 4000 Cent Florida Blvd, Orlando, FL 32816 USA";"University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida";Gibney, D (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Computat Sci & Engn, CODA Tech Sq,756 West Peachtree St NW,12th Fl, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.;"daniel.j.gibney@gmail.com; sharma.thankachan@ucf.edu";;Gibney, Daniel/0000-0003-1493-5432;"U.S. National Science Foundation [CCF1703489, CCF-2112643]; European Union'sHorizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [690941]";"U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Union'sHorizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(SKA South Africa)";This research is supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under the Grants CCF1703489 and CCF-2112643.

J;Zhang, YZ;;;;Zhang, Yezi;;;Development and Application of Artificial Intelligence Multimedia Technology Based on Big Data;MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Artificial intelligence is an innovative enterprise theme that combines computer science, physiology, science, and other disciplines, including expert programs, technical experiments, games, native language understanding, cognitive rehabilitation, robotics, engineering, recognition, and other fields. The breakthrough growth made the arrival of the era of big data have a fundamental impact on many traditional industries and has also promoted the transformation of teaching methods and methods in the field of education. In the traditional classroom, due to the limitations of teaching resources, teaching time, and location, students are basically passively accepted by the teacher, and the teaching form is single. This will improve in the age of big data with well-developed network message. Modern distance education uses advanced technology such as computer networks, multimedia, and artificial intelligence to build a virtual teaching environment based on the network. It breaks through the limitations of teachers, teaching materials, experimental equipment, and other resources that exist under the traditional teaching model. Using educational resources of the same scale can expand educational capabilities exponentially and at the same time overcomes the unified progress of traditional teaching methods, single teaching methods, and students' dissatisfaction. The shortcomings of differences and personalities that are not reflected are conducive to the improvement of the quality of education. It is the original intention of education to offer students special study resources and to stimulate students' enthusiasm for learning. To enhance the current learning environment, the article builds a personalized multimedia network teaching system based on big data and streaming media technology. By recording the teacher's class process as a video and uploading it to the multimedia network teaching system, students can watch and download related videos online for learning and also communicate online. The system can also provide personalized and intelligent recommendations for students based on student learning habits. The system is developed based on intelligent multimedia method and has the characteristics of security and stability and has done some help for network teaching of educational institutions.;[Zhang, Yezi] Catholic Univ Korea, Grad Sch, Seoul 14662, South Korea;Catholic University of Korea;Zhang, YZ (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Korea, Grad Sch, Seoul 14662, South Korea.;zhangyezi2020@gmail.com;;;;;;;25;0;0;5;30;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1574-017X;1875-905X;;MOB INF SYST;Mob.

This paper presents the results of a study that uses Hebrew NLP to automatically score student explanations in Biology according to fine-grained analytic grading rubrics that were developed for formative assessment. The experimental results show that our algorithms achieve a high-level of agreement with human experts, on par with previous work on automated assessment of scientific explanations in English, and that similar to 500 examples are typically enough to build reliable scoring models. The main contribution is twofold. First, we present a conceptual framework for constructing analytic grading rubrics for scientific explanations, which are composed of dichotomous categories that generalize across items. These categories are designed to support automated guidance, but can also be used to provide a composite score. Second, we apply this approach in a new context - Hebrew, which belongs to a group of languages known as MorphologicallyRich. In languages of this group, among them also Arabic and Turkish, each input token may consist of multiple lexical and functional units, making them particularly challenging for NLP. This is the first study on automatic assessment of scientific explanations (and more generally, of open-ended questions) in Hebrew, and among the firsts to do so in Morphologically-Rich Languages.;"[Ariely, Moriah; Nazaretsky, Tanya; Alexandron, Giora] Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel";Weizmann Institute of Science;Ariely, M (corresponding author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Rehovot, Israel.;"moriah.ariely@weizmann.ac.il; tanya.nazaretsky@weizmann.ac.il; giora.alexandron@weizmann.ac.il";"Ariely, Moriah/ADT-8885-2022; Nazaretsky, Tanya/IVH-3508-2023";"Ariely, Moriah/0000-0001-6539-3544; Nazaretsky, Tanya/0000-0003-1343-0627; Alexandron, Giora/0000-0003-2676-6912";"Willner Family Leadership Institute for the Weizmann Institute of Science; Iancovici-Fallmann Memorial Fund; Azrieli Foundation";"Willner Family Leadership Institute for the Weizmann Institute of Science; Iancovici-Fallmann Memorial Fund; Azrieli Foundation";The authors thank Cipy Hofman for her contribution.

However, autonomous machine operation in mill yards is challenging because of the dynamic and complex working environment and partly unstructured processes. The inherent complexity of wood handling and storage tasks requires significant human expertise. Rapid advancements in sensor technologies and machine learning techniques, along with increases in available computational power have enabled progress in automated operation frameworks and algorithms development, which opens the door to the introduction of novel autonomous systems into this environment. With the aim of gaining a better understanding of current issues and facilitating optimal strategies for the deployment of high-level autonomous systems in mill yard environments, this study: (1) utilizes a systematic literature review to map current autonomous technologies and algorithms suitable for adoption by the forest industry in automation of vehicles working in mill yards; (2) summarizes and discusses the potential feasibility of the considered sensors, systems and adoption strategies, and considers implementation challenges for high-level autonomous machinery in mill yard environments; and (3) proposes a system framework that integrates multiple technologies to enable autonomous navigation and material handling in mill yards. The study is the first of its kind as a comprehensive study on autonomous vehicles and machinery in mill yard environments.

Global and local interpretation is provided in such a way that the prediction accuracy of a single local observation is close to the model's overall prediction accuracy. For the earliest possible understanding of student performance, local and global interpretation is provided at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of course length. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) which are subfields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have recently emerged to assist all educational institution's in predicting the performance, engagement, and dropout rate of online students. Unfortunately, traditional ML and DL techniques lack in providing data analysis results in an understandable human way. Explainable AI (XAI), a new branch of AI, can be used in educational settings, specifically in VLEs, to provide the instructor with the study performance results of thousands or even millions of online students in a human-understandable way. Thus, unlike black box approaches such as traditional ML and DL techniques, XAI can help instructors to interpret the strengths and weaknesses of an individual student, providing them with timely personalized feedback and guidance. Various traditional and various ensemble ML algorithms were trained on demographic, clickstream, and assessment features to determine which algorithm gives the best performance result. The best-performing ML algorithm was ultimately selected and provided to the XAI model as an input for local and global interpretation of students' study behavior at various percentages of course length. We have used various XAI tools to give students' performance reports to instructors, in an explicable human way, at different stages of course length. The intermediate data analysis and performance reports will help instructors and all key stakeholders in decision-making and optimally facilitate online students.;"[Adnan, Muhammad; Uddin, M.

It is established through the merging of virtually improved physical and digital reality. Metaverse (MS) offers enhanced immersive experiences and a more interactive learning experience for students in learning and educational settings. It is an expanded and synchronous communication setting that allows different users to share their experiences. The present study aims to evaluate students' perception of the application of MS in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for medical-educational purposes. In this study, 1858 university students were surveyed to examine this model. The study's conceptual framework consisted of adoption constructs including Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Personal innovativeness (PI), Perceived Compatibility (PCO), User Satisfaction (US), Perceived Triability (PTR), and Perceived Observability (POB). The study was unique because the model correlated technology-based features and individual-based features. The study also used hybrid analyses such as Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The present study also employs the Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) to assess the importance and performance factors. The study finds US as an essential determinant of users' intention to use the metaverse (UMS). The present study's finding is useful for stakeholders in the educational sector in understanding the importance of each factor and in making plans based on the order of significance of each factor. The study also methodologically contributes to Information Systems (IS) literature because it is one of the few studies that have used a complementary multi-analytical approach such as ML algorithms to investigate the UMS metaverse systems.;"[Almarzouqi, Amina] Univ Sharjah, Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Serv Adm, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Aburayya, Ahmad] Dubai Hlth Author, Qual & Corp Dev Off, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Salloum, Said A.] Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England";"University of Sharjah; University of Salford";Salloum, SA (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Sci Engn & Environm, Manchester M5 4WT, Lancs, England.;s.a.s.salloum@edu.salford.ac.uk;"Salloum, Said/R-7208-2019; Aburayya, Dr. Prof. Ahmad/ABF-6600-2021";"Salloum, Said/0000-0002-6073-3981; Aburayya, Dr. Prof. Ahmad/0000-0002-1428-0547";;;;;91;101;101;24;258;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2022;10;;;;;;43421;43434;;10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3169285;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3169285;;;14;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";0W2ZO;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000788901700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, it is important to flag potential outliers for in-depth verification by domain experts. In this work we propose to unify two differing aspects of explainability with outlier detection. We argue for a broader adoption of prototype-based student networks capable of providing an example-based explanation for their prediction and at the same time identify regions of similarity between the predicted sample and the examples. The examples are real prototypical cases sampled from the training set via a novel iterative prototype replacement algorithm. Furthermore, we propose to use the prototype similarity scores for identifying outliers. We compare performance in terms of the classification, explanation quality and outlier detection of our proposed network with baselines. We show that our prototype-based networks extending beyond similarity kernels deliver meaningful explanations and promising outlier detection results without compromising classification accuracy.;"[Chong, Penny; Cheung, Ngai-Man] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Informat Sys tems Technol & Design Pillar, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Elovici, Yuval] Ben Gurion Univ Nev, Dept Software & Informat Syst Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Binder, Alexander] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, N-0373 Oslo, Norway";"Singapore University of Technology & Design; University of Oslo";Binder, A (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, N-0373 Oslo, Norway.;"penny_chong@mymail.sutd.edu.sg; ngaiman_cheung@sutd.edu.sg; elovici@bgu.ac.il; alexabin@ifi.uio.no";;"Cheung, Ngai-Man (Man)/0000-0003-0135-3791; Chong, Penny/0000-0001-8198-7369; Binder, Alexander/0000-0001-9605-6209; Elovici, Yuval/0000-0002-9641-128X";"ST Engineering Electronics, under its Corporate Laboratory@University Scheme; National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore, under its Corporate Laboratory@University Scheme; Research Council of Norway, via the SFI Visual Intelligence [309439]";"ST Engineering Electronics, under its Corporate Laboratory@University Scheme; National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore, under its Corporate Laboratory@University Scheme; Research Council of Norway, via the SFI Visual Intelligence(Research Council of Norway)";This work was supported in part by ST Engineering Electronics and the National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore, under its Corporate Laboratory@University Scheme (Title: STEE Infosec-SUTD Corporate Laboratory), and in part by the Research Council of Norway, via the SFI Visual Intelligence, under Project 309439.;;50;7;7;0;13;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1057-7149;1941-0042;;IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS;IEEE Trans.

Materials 4.0 is crucial to achieve these goals. The application of digital to the field of materials has been at the forefront of research for many years, but there does not exist a unified means to describe a framework for this area creating pockets of development. This is confounded by the broader expectations of a digital twin (DT) as the possible answer to all these problems. The issue being that there is no accepted definition of a component DT, and what information it should contain and how it can be implemented across the product lifecycle exist. Within this position paper, a clear distinction is made between the manufacturing DT and the component DT; the former being the starting boundary conditions of the latter. In order to achieve this, we also discuss the introduction of a digital thread as a key concept in passing data through manufacturing and into service. The stages of how to define a framework around the development of DTs from a materials perspective is given, which acknowledges the difference between creating new understanding within academia and the application of this knowledge on a per-component basis in industry.

This is followed by several machine learning techniques and a proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier optimized by the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and measured the corresponding performance. Then, the validity and accuracy of commonly used classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression Classifier, and Naive Bayes classifier, were reviewed. Moreover, LSTM based on the SSA classification model was compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB). Finally, as LSTM based SSA achieved the highest accuracy, it was applied to predict the sentiments of students' feedback and evaluate their association with the course outcome evaluations for education quality purposes.;"[El-Demerdash, Alaa A.; Hussein, Sherif E.; Zaki, John F.

The arduous task has two components: (i) improving the existing traffic policies based on a good understanding of risk factors related to trends in traffic accidents, and (ii) underpinning the emerging technologies that will advance the safety of vehicles. For the latter route, the introduction of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a promising option as CAVs can potentially reduce the number of accidents. However, to reap their benefits, they need to be introduced in a safe manner and tested for their ability to safely deal with risky scenarios. Unfortunately, the identification of such test scenarios remains a key challenge for the industry. This study contributes to increased safety by (i) analyzing UK's STATS19 accident data to identify patterns in past traffic accidents, and (ii) utilizing this information to systematically generate scenarios for CAV testing. For task (i), the patterns in the accidents were identified in terms of static and time-dependent internal and external factors. For this purpose, the study employed a clustering algorithm, COOLCAT, which is particularly suitable for dealing with high-dimensional categorical data. Six different clusters emerged naturally as a result of the algorithm. To interpret the clusters, we applied a frequency analysis to each cluster. The frequency tests showed that in each cluster, certain distinct real-world situations were represented more significantly compared to the non-clustered reference case, which are the markers of each cluster. The second task (ii) complemented the first task by synthesizing the relationships between attributes. This was done by association rule mining using the market basket analysis approach. The method enabled us to develop, drawing from the characteristics of the clusters, non-trivial test scenarios that can be used in the testing of CAVs, especially in virtual testing.;"[Esenturk, Emre; Wallace, Albert G.; Khastgir, Siddartha; Jennings, Paul] Univ Warwick, WMG, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England";University of Warwick;Esenturk, E (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, WMG, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;e.esenturk.1@warwick.ac.uk;;"Wallace, Albert/0000-0003-3209-7276; Esenturk, Emre/0000-0003-0380-5253";"Innovate U.K.; Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) through the OmniCAV Project [104529]; UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellowship [MR/S035176/1]; FLF [MR/S035176/1] Funding Source: UKRI";"Innovate U.K.(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) through the OmniCAV Project; UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); FLF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI))";This work was supported in part by the Innovate U.K. and Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) through the OmniCAV Project under Grant 104529, and in part by the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellowship under Grant MR/S035176/1.;;61;12;12;5;42;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2022;10;;;;;;6660;6675;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140052;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140052;;;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";YK8XG;;gold, Green Accepted;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000745488200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The default method to teach construction scheduling remains the critical path method, which suffers from lack of automa-tion, lack of dynamic change processes, and wrong assumptions about resource and spatial availability. New methods to automate construction scheduling, sometimes referred to as generative construction scheduling, have been developed but are seldom taught in construction management courses. This paper describes the design of a new curriculum to teach one new approach to construction scheduling called the Tri-Constraint Method. The proposed five-lesson, flipped-classroom curriculum is designed to illustrate limitations of the critical path method, explain the theoretical and computational foundations of a generative scheduling algorithm, and pro-vide practical experience through implementation with state-of-the-art software. To measure the impact of the curriculum on student learning, the paper conducts a descriptive statistical analysis, a paired t-test, and an ex-amination of qualitative feedback. Students who entered the course with either low or high prior knowledge of construction scheduling showed significant improvement in their understanding of the key concepts and the algorithmic approach behind the generative construction scheduling. Overall, this paper demonstrates how curriculum design in engineering informatics can combine theoretical understanding and practical imple-mentation to understand generative construction scheduling. The dissemination of this and similar teaching curricula can ensure that future engineering practitioners avoid black box implementations of automation software in their future careers.;"[Hall, Daniel M.; Sriram, Ravina] Inst Construction & Infrastructure Management, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomatic Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Chen, Qian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Div Civil Engn, 7a JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB30FA, Cambs, England; [Hall, Daniel M.] Inst Construction & Infrastructure Management IBI, Chair Innovat & Ind Construction, HIL 22-1,Stefano-Franscini-Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland";"Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Cambridge";Hall, DM (corresponding author), Inst Construction & Infrastructure Management IBI, Chair Innovat & Ind Construction, HIL 22-1,Stefano-Franscini-Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.;hall@ibi.baug.ethz.ch;Hall, Daniel/ABB-5310-2020;"Hall, Daniel/0000-0002-0957-484X; Custovic, Irfan/0000-0002-4872-6164";;;;;42;4;4;3;14;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1474-0346;1873-5320;;ADV ENG INFORM;Adv.

During formation, students in computer science can deal with moderately complex projects, nevertheless, dealing with such problems is relegated to the Degree Final Project. In this investigation we show the procedural steps of how project-based learning combined with game construction can effectively be used to promote engagement in informatic lectures at university. For the task, we build a 2D game engine and propose students to enroll in factitious research teams with the aim of programming intelligent agents that play the game employing artificial intelligence techniques. The intended principal outcome is to show evidence of the application of project-based learning in artificial intelligence within the lectures, and how it can be combined with game construction to increase motivation in the classroom. Project-based learning has the students learn, organize, and solve challenges while students themselves remain their own responsible for the investigation and process of work. We propose to follow a series of sequential phases that conform a set of milestones that incorporate a project-based learning approach to the lectures. Through this work we show that the use of project-based learning combined with game construction provides reliable evidence that a much deeper understanding about artificial intelligence is attained by students participating in the challenge.

Here, we slightly modified Scratch to make it easy for students to create these basic building blocks. Also, because our example applications are based on the Data & Analysis subconcepts (Storage, Collection, Visualization, Transformation, and Inference & Models) of ACM CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards, students can achieve these standards and gain an understanding of text processing by implementing them.

J;Yang, JP;;;;Yang, Jipeng;;;Research on the Artificial Intelligence Teaching System Model for Online Teaching of Classical Music under the Support of Wireless Networks;WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;For the past year, everyone has been facing difficulties due to the fast spreading of the Corona Virus. As an extension, students, parents, and teachers are handling the challenges in the education sector. Since the COVID days, the schools and colleges were closed, and hence, the students were lagging in their subjects. As an alternative to this scenario, offline classes are converted to online courses, otherwise called virtual classes with virtual classrooms. Due to this conversion, the teaching has become a little more advanced by incorporating various computer-based technologies. The technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and machine learning paved the way for exploring concepts in data transmission in terms of timely delivery of content, less error rate, and nontechnical terms like making the classes interactive and understanding the subject concepts. In this research work, the online teaching class on music is considered. To be specific, traditional Chinese music is taken for the study. An artificial intelligence model is designed with the aid of wireless sensor networks for the online class on the musical subject. Q-learning algorithm, which is an artificial intelligence-based reinforcement learning algorithm, is implemented. The aim of the Q-learning algorithm in this online teaching of classical music is to check the frequency level of the music that aids in the automatic transfer of another wavelength inside the dataset.;[Yang, Jipeng] Yanan Univ, Lu Xun Coll Art, Yanan 716000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China;Yanan University;Yang, JP (corresponding author), Yanan Univ, Lu Xun Coll Art, Yanan 716000, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;yangjpnjny@njau.edu.cn;;;;;;;31;3;3;3;12;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

Semi-online is an intermediate theoretically and practically significant framework with additional information on the successive inputs to address the limitations of online and offline frameworks. One key motivation for studying semi-online algorithms is to investigate how additional information can improve the performance of online algorithms. In online scheduling, jobs are received one by one and each job must be scheduled irrevocably before the availability of the next job. Semi-online scheduling is a relaxed variant of online scheduling, where some Extra Piece Information (EPI) about the whole job sequence is known a priori, or additional algorithmic extensions are allowed. The EPI may include one or more of the following parameter(s) such as the maximum processing time, the total sum of the processing time of all jobs, arrival sequence of the jobs based on processing time, optimum makespan value, or the range of processing time. The design of improved competitive semi-online algorithms for m-machine scheduling problem has received significant research attention after the seminal works of Liu et al. (1996) and Kellerer et al. (1997). In this survey article, we highlight the scholarly contributions and stateof-the-art results for semi-online scheduling on parallel machine models such as identical, uniformly related, and unbounded batch by considering preemptive and non-preemptive as the processing formats with optimality criteria such as makespan, load balancing, machine cost, Lp-norm load balancing, early work maximization, and the sum of completion time plus total penalty cost. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the online and semi-online frameworks for the m-machine scheduling problem and presentation of a standard well-known algorithmic performance measure, the competitive analysis. Practical applications, preliminary concepts, research motivation, and taxonomy of semi-online scheduling are presented as a foundation for a basic understanding of the area. State-of-the-art results achieved by the deterministic semi-online algorithms are classified and presented based on machine models and known EPI with a special focus on novel intuitions and algorithmic development. We discuss and analyze the impact of EPI on the competitive performance of semi-online algorithms. A classification of the references based on specific EPI is outlined for further research investigation. Finally, we conclude the survey with non-trivial research challenges and open problems.;"[Dwibedy, Debasis; Mohanty, Rakesh] Veer Surendra Sai Univ Technol, Burla 768018, Odisha, India; [Mohanty, Rakesh] Veer Surendra Sai Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Burla 768018, Odisha, India";"Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology; Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology";"Dwibedy, D; Mohanty, R (corresponding author), Veer Surendra Sai Univ Technol, Burla 768018, Odisha, India.;Mohanty, R (corresponding author), Veer Surendra Sai Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Burla 768018, Odisha, India.";"debasis.dwibedy@gmail.com; rakesh.iitmphd@gmail.com";"; DWIBEDY, Dr. DEBASIS/B-9324-2019";"MOHANTY, RAKESH/0000-0002-7002-4142; DWIBEDY, Dr. DEBASIS/0000-0001-7690-8398";Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla, Odisha, India;Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla, Odisha, India;We extend our gracious acknowledgment to Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla, Odisha, India for supporting our current research work.

However, challenges associated with spatiotemporal contexts of construction sites and resource limitations of educational programs reduce the opportunities available for students to practice these skills. This study focuses on using 360-degree panoramic virtual environments enhanced with virtual humans to produce realistic site visits for practicing collaborative problem-solving opportunities (iVisit-Collaborate). The goal of this phenomenological research study is to understand the collaborative problem-solving process of student dyads within iVisit-Collaborate. The findings suggest that student collaborative behaviors did not directly result in successful problem-solving. A hierarchical relationship between student problem-solving and collaborative behaviors was observed, indicating that problem-solving behaviors must take place to enable the occurrence of collaborative behaviors. Moreover, it was also observed that instructor scaffolding helped reduce the degrees of freedom in complex problem-solving activities. Finally, it was observed that student discussion engagement supported the creation and maintenance of shared mental models.;"[Eiris, Ricardo] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Wen, Jing; Gheisari, Masoud] Univ Florida, Rinker Sch Construct Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA";"Michigan Technological University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida";Eiris, R (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.;"reiris@mtu.edu; wen.jing@ufl.edu; masoud@ufl.edu";Eiris, Ricardo/ABE-6258-2020;"Eiris, Ricardo/0000-0001-6904-5352; WEN, JING/0000-0002-9111-9378; Gheisari, Masoud/0000-0001-5568-9923";"National Science Foundation [1821852]; Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources [1821852] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";"National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Undergraduate Education; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))";This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1821852.

Faced with the information management of a large number of students, the workload and work pressure of consultants at various universities have doubled. The rapid and effective development of modern computer software and hardware has also initiated and effectively developed the informatization process of universities. The student management system is the core and foundation of the entire school education management system. This study mainly introduces the application of student behavior analysis and research models based on clustering technology. This paper uses the application research of student behavior analysis and research model based on clustering technology, uses clustering technology to analyze student behavior, and reasonably analyzes the feasibility of KMEANS algorithm and campus data mining. The cluster analysis algorithm is used to divide students into different groups according to the characteristics of the students, and then, data analysis and data association rules' mining are performed on each group of students. At the same time, the decision tree algorithm is used to predict the future of students based on the historical data of the students and the current data of the students. The development status of the school helps the school to understand the situation of the students in real time, make predictions and warnings for possible situations, provide personalized applications for teachers and students, and provide decision-making support for the management. It can be seen from the experimental analysis that the application of student behavior analysis and research models based on clustering technology has increased the efficiency of student education by 17%. The limitations of student behavior analysis and research on clustering technology provide good applications for the KMEANS algorithm. Analysis, discussion, and summary of the methods and approaches are obtained to enrich the academic research results.;"[Li, Guozhang] Hainan Vocat Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Haikou 571126, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Li, Guozhang; Alfred, Rayner] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fak Komputeran & Informat, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia; [Wang, Xue] Hainan Vocat Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Courses, Haikou 571126, Hainan, Peoples R China";"Hainan Vocational University of Science & Technology; Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Hainan Vocational University of Science & Technology";"Li, GZ (corresponding author), Hainan Vocat Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Haikou 571126, Hainan, Peoples R China.;Li, GZ (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fak Komputeran & Informat, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.";201914040001@zknu.edu.cn;Li, Guozhang/AAY-7052-2021;;Hainan Provice for Education and Teaching Research Projects in Colleges and Universities in 2021 [Hnjg2021-118];Hainan Provice for Education and Teaching Research Projects in Colleges and Universities in 2021;AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by Hainan Provice for Education and Teaching Research Projects in Colleges and Universities in 2021 (project no.

The field of quantum computing is built on the solid foundations of computational science that the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship continues to build. In this special research retrospective, I discuss my path in quantum computing research that receiving this award made possible. Starting with an introduction to quantum computing, I discuss how variational methods came to be popular on quantum computing hardware today, and the need to mitigate errors. The setting of variational algorithms facilitates a connection between quantum computers and the theory of machine learning, leading to discovery of phenomena, such as barren plateaus in the training landscape. This connection has allowed us to better understand the role of data, and how data can elevate machine learning models above traditional computation.;[McClean, Jarrod R.] Google Quantum AI, Venice, CA 90291 USA;Google Incorporated;McClean, JR (corresponding author), Google Quantum AI, Venice, CA 90291 USA.;;;McClean, Jarrod/0000-0002-2809-0509;;;;;8;0;0;0;3;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1521-9615;1558-366X;;COMPUT SCI ENG;Comput.

With the advancement of technology, many tools have been developed to provide personalized feedback. However, these systems are only beneficial when interactions are done on digital platforms. As paper-based assessment is still a dominantly preferred evaluation method, particularly in large blended-instruction classes, the sole use of electronic educational systems presents a gap between how students learn the subject from the physical and digital world. This has motivated the design and the development of a new educational technology that facilitates the digitization, grading, and distribution of paper-based assessments to support blended-instruction classes. With the aid of this technology, different learning analytics can be readily captured. A retrospective analysis was conducted to understand the students' behaviors in an Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures class from a public university. Their behavioral differences and the associated learning impacts were analyzed by leveraging their digital footprints. Results showed that students made significant efforts in reviewing their examinations. Notably, the high-achieving and the improving students spent more time reviewing their mistakes and started doing so as soon as the assessment became available. Finally, when students were guided in the reviewing process, they were able to identify items where they had misconceptions.;"[Paredes, Yancy Vance] Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp & Augmented Intelligence, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Hsiao, I-Han] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA";"Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Santa Clara University";Paredes, YV (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp & Augmented Intelligence, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.;"yvmparedes@asu.edu; ihsiao@scu.edu";;Paredes, Yancy Vance/0000-0002-8039-7970;;;;;43;1;1;2;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;NOV;2021;12;11;;;;;;;450;10.3390/info12110450;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info12110450;;;16;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;VL7XS;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000912920500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

While the JDK API allows for a functional paradigm, for API consumers to be able to completely embrace Java's new functional features, third-party APIs must also support lambda expressions. To understand the current state of the Java ecosystem, we investigate (i) the extent to which third-party Java APIs have changed their interfaces, (ii) why or why not they introduce functional interface support and (iii) in the case the API has changed its interface how it does so. We also investigate the consumers' perspective, particularly their ease in using lambda expressions in Java with APIs. We perform our investigation by manually analyzing the top 50 popular Java APIs, conducting in-person and email interviews with 23 API producers, and surveying 110 developers. We find that only a minority of the top 50 APIs support functional interfaces, the rest does not support them, predominantly in the interest of backward compatibility. Java 7 support is still greatly desirable due to enterprise projects not migrating to newer versions of Java. This suggests that the Java ecosystem is stagnant and that the introduction of new language features will not be enough to save it from the advent of new languages such as Kotlin (JVM based) and Rust (non-JVM based).;"[Petrulio, Fernando; Bacchelli, Alberto] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Sawant, Anand Ashok] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA";"University of Zurich; University of California System; University of California Davis";Sawant, AA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;"fpetrulio@ifi.uzh.ch; asawant@ucdavis.edu; bacchelli@ifi.uzh.ch";Bacchelli, Alberto/ABG-5379-2020;"Bacchelli, Alberto/0000-0003-0193-6823; Sawant, Anand/0000-0002-5816-8020";"Swiss National Science Foundation through the SNF [PP00P2_170529]; NSF CISE (SHF LARGE) [1414172]; Sandia National Laboratories";"Swiss National Science Foundation through the SNF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NSF CISE (SHF LARGE); Sandia National Laboratories(United States Department of Energy (DOE))";Alberto Bacchelli and Fernando Petrulio gratefully acknowledge the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation through the SNF Project No. PP00P2_170529.

In college education, English translation is a very popular and important subject. Although the teaching mode is constantly changing, it still lags behind the speed of social and economic development. Traditional English translation teaching has many disadvantages in teaching theory and methods. This paper discusses the problems existing in translation teaching for English majors and then puts forward a new teaching mode of educational multiattitude resources, to really improve the quality of translation teaching for English majors. The resource pool of cloud computing is composed of a large number of resource nodes with different performances, but as the number of users gradually grows, the demand also increases. How to efficiently allocate large-scale cloud tasks to limited resource nodes and to achieve load balancing is an important issue that needs to be studied in cloud computing. This paper first uses the literature method, in-depth study of the theoretical development, and application bottleneck of education multiposture teaching mode at the same time to understand the problems existing in the current English translation teaching and design a new teaching mode for experimental application research and finally analyzes the comparison of the English translation ability of the control group and the experimental group without teaching method. After a period of experiment, the average score of the control group is 70.53, and the average score of the experimental group is 75.89. It can be seen that the average score of the experimental group is about 5 points higher than that of the control group; this shows that the intelligent optimization algorithm of cloud computing is combined with translation teaching that can improve the students' overall English translation level to a certain extent and is more conducive to the students' comprehensive mastery of knowledge.";"[Zhang, Wanfang] Wuhan Polytech Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan 430023, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yin, Hexiao] East China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Criminal Law, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China";"Wuhan Polytechnic University; East China University Political Science & Law";Yin, HX (corresponding author), East China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Criminal Law, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China.;2945@ecupl.edu.cn;Wang, Ling/KBA-9814-2024;Wang, Ling/0000-0003-0272-2974;"Wuhan Polytechnic University [XZ2020011]; 2020 Philosophy and Social Science Project of Hubei Province [20D059]";"Wuhan Polytechnic University; 2020 Philosophy and Social Science Project of Hubei Province";Acknowledgments This work was supported by the 2020 teaching research project of Wuhan Polytechnic University: A Four-Dimensional Model Construction of Case Base for Translation Courses (Project Number: XZ2020011).

This article combines algorithm and language disciplines. According to the results of Praat and SPSS: 55-80 points account for 70%, 55 points below 20% and 80 points above 10%, we find that intrinsic motivation plays a role in CSL acquisition, a vital role. Intrinsic motivation can help mature learners from Southeast Asia to acquire Chinese better and better. The earlier you learn Chinese, the higher your motivation, and the easier it is to set your Chinese learning goals. The greater the enthusiasm for learning Chinese, the better the Chinese scores (such as HSK test scores and Chinese phonetic test scores). Therefore, the Chinese proficiency of international students has a great relationship with their interest in Chinese language, that is, the greater the interest in Chinese, the stronger their motivation to learn, and the Chinese proficiency will be very good.;"[Shi, Liu] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Li, Moyan] Shantou Polytech, Sch Humanist & Social Sci, Shantou 515000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Su, Yawen] Jimei Univ, Teachers Coll, Xiamen 361000, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yi] Shantou Polytech, Skill Training Ctr, Shantou 515000, Guangdong, Peoples R China";"Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Jimei University";Su, YW (corresponding author), Jimei Univ, Teachers Coll, Xiamen 361000, Fujian, Peoples R China.;s1110624@s.eduhk.hk;;Su, Yawen/0009-0005-9387-013X;;;;;28;1;1;2;8;WILEY-HINDAWI;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND;1530-8669;1530-8677;;WIREL COMMUN MOB COM;Wirel.

With technology constantly evolving, the types and numbers of cyberattacks affect different users in different ways. The majority of recorded cyberattacks can be traced to human errors. Despite being both knowledge- and environment-dependent, studies show that increasing users' cybersecurity awareness is found to be one of the most effective protective approaches. However, the intangible nature, socio-technical dependencies, constant technological evolutions, and ambiguous impact make it challenging to offer comprehensive strategies for better communicating and combatting cyberattacks. Research in the industrial sector focused on creating institutional proprietary risk-aware cultures. In contrast, in academia, where cybersecurity awareness should be at the core of an academic institution's mission to ensure all graduates are equipped with the skills to combat cyberattacks, most of the research focused on understanding students' attitudes and behaviors after infusing cybersecurity awareness topics into some courses in a program. This work proposes a conceptual Cybersecurity Awareness Framework to guide the implementation of systems to improve the cybersecurity awareness of graduates in any academic institution. This framework comprises constituents designed to continuously improve the development, integration, delivery, and assessment of cybersecurity knowledge into the curriculum of a university across different disciplines and majors; this framework would thus lead to a better awareness among all university graduates, the future workforce. This framework may be adjusted to serve as a blueprint that, once adjusted by academic institutions to accommodate their missions, guides institutions in developing or amending their policies and procedures for the design and assessment of cybersecurity awareness.";"[Khader, Mohammed] Appl Sci Private Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Al Arab St 21, Amman 11931, Jordan; [Karam, Marcel] St George Univ Beirut, Dept Informat Technol, Beirut 11002807, Lebanon; [Fares, Hanna] St George Univ Beirut, Dept Biol, Beirut 11002807, Lebanon";;Karam, M (corresponding author), St George Univ Beirut, Dept Informat Technol, Beirut 11002807, Lebanon.;"m_khader@asu.edu.jo; mkaram@sgub.edu.lb; hfares@sgub.edu.lb";;Khader, Mohammed/0000-0002-5849-7609;Applied Science Private University, Amman,Jordan;Applied Science Private University, Amman,Jordan;The authors are grateful to the Applied Science Private University, Amman,Jordan, for the full financial support granted to cover the publication fee of this research article.;;52;7;14;5;25;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;OCT;2021;12;10;;;;;;;417;10.3390/info12100417;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info12100417;;;20;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;WS9CA;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000715472600001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Alshmrany, S;;;;Alshmrany, Sami;;;Adaptive learning style prediction in e-learning environment using levy flight distribution based CNN model;CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"E-learning; Learning style prediction; Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model; Convolutional neural network; Levy flight distribution algorithm";"INTERFACE; SYSTEM";A learning style that focuses on individual learning is one of the most important aspects of any learning environment. Each learner has a unique manner of understanding, retaining, processing, and interpreting new information based on their learning styles. The ability of an e-learning system to automatically determine a student's learning style has become more essential. For learning events, the evolution of e-learning platforms provides students with higher opportunities online. In this paper, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network-based Levy Flight Distribution (CNN-LFD) algorithm for learning style prediction. An adaptive e-learning system is divided into two sections: automatic learning style prediction and classification based on the number of learning styles included. Initially, the student logs in with their user ID, and the data is saved in the database. The features such as questionnaire score, login credentials (session ID, learner ID, and course ID), and login time (location, session ID) are extracted along with the sequence of the user's learning behavior. After that, the CNN-LFD algorithm predicts the learning styles of the learners namely Active/reflective, Sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, sequential/global based on the extracted features. The dataset information are gathered from a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), and the proposed model is built in JAVA software. The experimental results demonstrate higher classification accuracy during learning style prediction. The proposed CNN-LFD algorithm accomplishes 97.09% accuracy, 94.76% specificity, 92.12% sensitivity, and 97.56%, precision values than other methods.;[Alshmrany, Sami] Islamic Univ Madinah, Fac Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah, Saudi Arabia;Islamic University of Al Madinah;Alshmrany, S (corresponding author), Islamic Univ Madinah, Fac Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah, Saudi Arabia.;s.alshmrany@iu.edu.sa;;;;;;;47;16;16;2;32;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;1386-7857;1573-7543;;CLUSTER COMPUT;Cluster Comput.;FEB;2022;25;1;;;;;523;536;;10.1007/s10586-021-03403-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10586-021-03403-3;;SEP 2021;14;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;YJ5MG;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000702173200001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;de Prado, JEL;;;;Llamazares de Prado, Jose Enrique;;;Sign language teaching technological advances and differences in international contexts;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Deaf; Education; Sign; Disability";RECOGNITION;Purpose The main objective of this article is to contribute to the field of accessibility in the teaching of sign language in the international panorama, examining its applicability, evaluation methods as well as the assistive technologies used to improve teaching experiences and the creation of new materials, proposing a theoretical framework that relates the teaching of sign language at different academic levels, the training of teachers, as well as parents, and the use of technology to achieve educational inclusion. It follows that the adoption of hybrid technology approaches, following universal design principles, can help to integrate access to education and sign language literacy. Design/methodology/approach The working method used to carry out this work consists of a systematic review of the scientific literature. This is a research project based on the recapitulation of information about sign language in the international panorama and the improvements used for its instruction. For this purpose, the well-known PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) is used to synthesize the search carried out. A systematic review of the articles published in scientific journals about pedagogy in the teaching of sign language in the international field and technological innovation for sign language teaching has been carried out, incorporating different approaches and personal assessments. The first phase of the method consists of identifying and analyzing the articles published in scientific journals on the teaching of sign language on the international scene and the importance of new educational models with the incorporation of various didactic adaptations, evaluating the selected articles over a period of time from 2009 to 2021. Six steps were used in the systematic review study (Figure 1). First, Steps 1-4 were conducted in 2020 and 2021 as part of a doctoral research. A schematic summary of Steps 1-4 is presented below, followed by Steps 5 and 6, added later to the study after completion of Step 4. In the case of the first four steps they were conducted by two researchers: the thesis tutor and the doctoral student, and Steps 5 and 6 were conducted by the Ph. Findings To carry out the analysis of the results, the codification of the variables was carried out. The selected studies are characterized by their international context with a final selection of 39 studies have found several variables that affect the relationship between the teaching of sign language in the international arena and the use of technological innovations to adapt their teaching to students (Figure 4). In this section we present the technology grouped variables included in each factor and the possibilities of standardization and applicability of sign language teaching in the international panorama. Within these articles, the importance of defining training programs in sign language for teachers and the need to evaluate teaching programs is identified, with a focus on actions to improve school curricula to achieve linguistic standardization and inclusion in the academic environment, as well as their use at all levels of education. Therefore, professional practices and cooperation between institutions such as: associations of families of deaf students and educational institutions must be improved, making it possible to give a quality education. Within the exclusion criteria, the articles that do not use sign language teaching tools (n = 45) were subsequently discarded, followed by the articles that do not indicate any intervention in students with disabilities (n = 48), concluding with the articles that nonsign language disability education (n = 44). Subsequently, among those selected, the technology articles that do not speak about sign language were discarded (n = 32), as well as the studies that protect indigenous language but not sign language (n = 33) and, to conclude, the linguistic normalization articles but do not cite sign language (n = 37). Originality/value Communication is the element by which the authors can understand each other with the rest of the people around us, in the diversity of language, within non-verbal language, the authors find sign language, the language of deaf and mute people, of families, as a professional employee and nowadays, learned by many non-deaf and mute people to achieve a more inclusive and integrated society with all people. Every country has the right to have its own sign language, especially one that claims its culture and customs, through non-verbal communication with which to express multiple meanings, emotions and intentions. It is essential to know and apply the technological advances that are being developed, promoting the right to autonomy and the defense of the indigenous language as a cultural element of the intangible heritage of each country. The use of technology allows the democratization of culture and access to information regardless of where one lives in the world, in an increasingly globalized society in which communication plays a fundamental role. In the case of the global pandemic, it has forced us to the advancement of home education and the use of efficient digital tools to achieve it such as videoconferencing, in the field of disability there are still many limitations on this use by the various companies that develop them. Within the inclusive educational research the authors must emphasize the need for equality of tools and content for all types of students, especially in sign language. Large digital gaps have been generated in families with and without resources at international level, which also have a member with a disability, this is pointed out in the research mentioning the current situation of the American continent, as well as the search for improvement of the tools and platforms in which they are developed.;[Llamazares de Prado, Jose Enrique] Univ Leon, Leon, Spain;Universidad de Leon;de Prado, JEL (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Leon, Spain.;llamazaresprado@gmail.com;de Prado, José Enrique Llamazares/D-8247-2015;;;;;;39;2;4;1;19;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;Leeds;Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2056-4880;;;INT J INF LEARN TECH;Int.

Considering that typical computers and even the common smartphone are multicore, students should be skilled in parallel programming. Integrating parallel programming and soft skills within courses can help educate students on these essential skills. Our goal is to explore the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach these skills when classes are at content capacity. We divide 247 students into 51 diverse groups and assigned five projects, each of two-week duration. We use pre-and post-surveys to measure growth and found that incorporating PBL has a significant effect on the students' parallel programming and soft skills. We show that through teamwork, students collaboratively learn and apply fundamental parallel programming and soft skills without direct guidance, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of PBL. The implementation was conducted in a course that does not traditionally teach parallel programming concepts, but with the use of a PBL approach, students were able to acquire this new knowledge.

See DEC, 2022);NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS;;;English;"Article; Retracted Publication";;;;;;"Algorithm dimension; Artificial intelligence; Governance risk; Policy optimization";;With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and continuous in-depth integration with big data, cloud computing, robotics, and the Internet, especially the Internet of Things and blockchain, the reconstruction of society has been accelerated. This process not only enables epidemic prevention and control, economic transformation and growth, social governance reform and upgrading, and improvement in people's well-being but also puts forward many new challenges to social governance. The development of artificial intelligence must require the establishment of ethical standards and systems to be at the same frequency, and the development speed of the two must be coordinated to ensure the healthy development of technology. However, artificial intelligence not only brings convenience to people's lives but also raises people's concerns about its ramifications. To understand the influence of AI on governance in the algorithm dimension, a model of the influence of AI governance is built by using a parallel algorithm. It is necessary to learn new knowledge of social governance in the era of artificial intelligence and establish concomitant new ideas of social governance to explore a new way of social governance in the era of artificial intelligence. The research results show that after the introduction of artificial intelligence embedded governance, the governance level is greatly improved, the problem solving rate is increased by more than 50%, the satisfaction of the masses is increased by 30%, and the governance cost is reduced by 20%. However, people do not know much about the risks of artificial intelligence. Only approximately 10% of the population has a clear understanding of the risks of artificial intelligence. The research results show that artificial intelligence can play an important role in governance, but it is necessary to prevent the risks of artificial intelligence to better promote social development.;"[Xia, Jing; Yan, Yongcai] Hubei Normal Univ, Sch Econ Management & Law, Huangshi 435002, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ji, Lei] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Law, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China";"Hubei Normal University; Hubei University of Economics";Ji, L (corresponding author), Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Law, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China.;"xjing198258@163.com; yanyc@hbnu.edu.cn; jilei@hbue.edu.cn";;;"Special Soft Science Project of Technological Innovation of Hubei Province [2019ADC103]; Hubei Province Philosophy Social Sciences Program [19Q116]; Hubei Normal University Scientific Research Innovation Team Plans [2019CP01]; Hubei University of Economics Scientific Research Cultivate Project";"Special Soft Science Project of Technological Innovation of Hubei Province; Hubei Province Philosophy Social Sciences Program; Hubei Normal University Scientific Research Innovation Team Plans; Hubei University of Economics Scientific Research Cultivate Project";"This work was supported by Special Soft Science Project of Technological Innovation of Hubei Province (2019ADC103); Hubei Province Philosophy Social Sciences Program (19Q116); Hubei Normal University Scientific Research Innovation Team Plans (2019CP01).

Yet, there is limited research that reports on the adoption and actual use of LA to support teacher inquiry. This four-year longitudinal study captures sentiment of postgraduate students at a university in Ireland, by integrating LA with the steps of teacher inquiry. This study makes three important contributions to teaching and learning literature. First, it reports on the use of LA to support teacher inquiry over four one-year cycles of a Master of Science in Business Analytics programme between 2016 and 2020. Second, it provides evidence-based recommendations on how to optimise LA to support teacher inquiry, with specific attention as to how these can improve the assimilation of LA into the curriculum design and delivery.

Educational institutions around the world have stressed online learning programs in the aftermath of the pandemic. However, because of insufficient access to Information Communication Technology (ICT), a substantial number of students failed to harness the opportunity of online learning. This study explores the latent digital divide exhibited during the COVID-19 pandemic while online learning activities are emphasised among students of Bangladesh. It also investigates the digital divide exposure and the significant underlying drivers of the divide. In order to accomplish this, a cross-sectional survey was employed to collect quantitative data, mixed with open-ended questions were utilised to gather qualitative information from the student community. The findings revealed that despite the majority of students having physical access to ICT, only 32.5% of students could attend online classes seamlessly. In total, 34.1% reported data prices as the critical barrier, while 39.8% identified poor network infrastructure as the significant barrier preventing them from participating in online learning activities. Although most students possess physical access to various devices and the Internet, they face the first-level digital divide due to the quality of access and price of cellular Internet. Consequently, they fail to take advantage of physical access, resulting in the third-level digital divide (utility gap), which submerges them into a digital divide cycle. The primary objective of this study is to explore the underlying issues of the digital divide among Bangladeshi students.

Peer review is a promising solution but can be unreliable due to few reviewers and an unevaluated review form. To date, no work has leveraged sentiment analysis in the peer-review process to inform or validate grades or utilized aspect extraction to craft a review form from what students actually communicated. This article utilizes, rather than discards, student data from review form comments to deliver better information to the instructor. In this article, we detail the process by which we create our domain-dependent lexicon and aspect-informed review form as well as our entire sentiment analysis algorithm, which provides a fine-grained sentiment score from text alone. We end by analyzing validity and discussing conclusions from our corpus of over 6800 peer reviews from nine courses to understand the viability of sentiment in the classroom for increasing the information from and reliability of grading open-ended assignments in large courses.;"[Beasley, Zachariah J.; Piegl, Les A.; Rosen, Paul] Univ S Florida, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tampa, FL 33620 USA";"State University System of Florida; University of South Florida";Beasley, ZJ (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.;"zjb@usf.edu; lpiegl@gmail.com; prosen@usf.edu";;"Piegl, Les/0000-0003-0629-8496; Rosen, Paul/0000-0002-0873-9518";;;;;63;2;2;2;29;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

J;Hill, H;;;;Hill, Heather;;;A thematic analysis of library association policies on services to persons with disabilities;JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Disability; Accessibility; American Library Association; Australian Library and Information Association; Canadian Federation of Library Associations; Library associations; Library policy";"HEALTH-SCIENCES-LIBRARIANSHIP; WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY; INFORMATION; ETHICS; VALUES; PATRONS; CODES";Purpose Library association policies and guidelines are important to study because they reflect consensus values of the profession. As such, they can shape the association, itself, and set the tone for the values of its individual members in their professional practice. From the titles alone, these documents proclaim themselves to be guides for the development of individual library policy. Additionally, as library and information science (LIS) graduate education programs are accredited by national associations, LIS schools pay attention to association policies and guidelines to help shape professional and continuing education. In these ways, they have a role in shaping professional ideology around a topic. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The services to persons with disabilities policies from three national-level LIS organizations were analyzed through a thematic analysis. Findings The guidelines speak to a shared understanding of disability and accessibility around the themes of library staff, library policies and library resources and services. While not surprising, additional themes around disability context and legislation show a shared understanding of accessibility that is much broader than what the legislation requires. Originality/value An analysis of guidelines on services to persons with disabilities from the American Library Association (ALA), Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) and Canadian Federation of Library Associations (CFLA) is of interest because of the ways these organizations intersect. The ALA and ALIA have reciprocal agreements so that students in LIS education programs are recognized as equivalents. Second, the ALA accredits library education programs in Canada. Given these intersecting relationships, the guidelines-shared notions of accessibility become of high interest.;[Hill, Heather] Western Univ, Fac Informat & Media Studies, London, ON, Canada;Western University (University of Western Ontario);Hill, H (corresponding author), Western Univ, Fac Informat & Media Studies, London, ON, Canada.;hhill6@uwo.ca;;Hill, Heather/0000-0001-7698-3662;;;;;70;3;4;2;47;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;Leeds;Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0022-0418;1758-7379;;J DOC;J.

Among the point cloud processing methods, instance segmentation of point cloud is extremely important since the quality of segmentation will affect the performance of subsequent algorithms. In this paper, the 3D reconstruction process of RGB-D sensor is analyzed, and a framework PointSeg is proposed to handle the instance segmentation of point cloud captured by RGB-D sensor. The PointSeg realizes point cloud instance segmentation by applying the deep learning method YOLACT++ to instance segment the color image first and then matching the instance information with the point cloud. In addition, an experimental platform that is equipped with a Kinect v2 is built, and a dataset is set up and then the PointSeg is tested on the dataset. The result shows that the PointSeg achieves point cloud instance segmentation according to the instance information extracted from color images, which not only has good real-time performance but also has better instance segmentation accuracy compared with the method of conducting instance segmentation directly on point cloud data, and the introduction of data augmentation in the training phase can achieve good training effect even on a small training dataset.;"[Wang, Zhengtuo; Xu, Yuetong; Yu, Jiongyan; Xu, Guanhua; Fu, Jianzhong; Gu, Tianyi] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Mfg Technol & Equipment Automat, Coll Mech Engn, State Key Lab Fluid Power & Mech Syst, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhengtuo; Xu, Yuetong; Yu, Jiongyan; Xu, Guanhua; Fu, Jianzhong] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Mfg Technol & Equipment Automat, Coll Mech Engn, Key Lab Printing Proc & Equipment Zhejiang Prov 3, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jiongyan] Suzhou Zijingang Intelligent Mfg Equipment Co Ltd, Suzhou, Peoples R China";"Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University";"Xu, YT (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Mfg Technol & Equipment Automat, Coll Mech Engn, State Key Lab Fluid Power & Mech Syst, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Xu, YT (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Mfg Technol & Equipment Automat, Coll Mech Engn, Key Lab Printing Proc & Equipment Zhejiang Prov 3, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.";xyt@zju.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51805477]; Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51821093]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))";This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81827804), Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51821093), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51805477).

Yet, it is worth highlighting the fact that AI as a tool for education has its main roots in the way AI is taught to students, leading to the development of many educational models, seeking to accelerate the learning curve of fuzzy logic concepts and their suitability for control systems. Nevertheless, most of those methodologies are mainly focused on theoretical concepts, without improving disciplinary and transversal competences that are developed through experimental challenges; consequently, knowledge acquisition is incomplete, and the industrial requirements are not fulfilled. Henceforth, this work proposes a model inspired by the Systems Development V-Model, which allows students to understand the entire fuzzy logic controllers design process through an experimental product development process that improves lifelong learning features in students. Besides, this model supports the Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) in students, encouraging new skills development and experience gain for fuzzy logic controllers designs. Moreover, the proposed methodology in this paper, covers the adapted V-model for education to understand the designing process for fuzzy logic controllers, through a Quadcopter case study, selected due to the complexity of the system, which (as supported from the results) also leads to improve the background skills in engineering students. Therefore, results show that this model enhances student's capacity to develop functional prototypes and promotes technological products development. Then, as validated through an expert review committee within the engineering technical field, this proposal could be easily suited into several engineering topics; such as, Electronic circuits design, Power electronics and so on.";"[Ponce, Pedro; Mendez, Efrain; Molina, Arturo] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City 14380, DF, Mexico";Tecnologico de Monterrey;Mendez, E (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Mexico City 14380, DF, Mexico.;efrain@tec.mx;;"Mendez Flores, Efrain/0000-0002-5893-4071; molina, Arturo/0000-0001-5461-2879";;;;;29;4;4;0;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0045-7906;1879-0755;;COMPUT ELECTR ENG;Comput.

To effectively promote and implement programming in K-12 education, it is necessary to understand school principals' perception of programming education. This study adopted a mixed methods design to explain principals' understanding, expectations, and support for programming education in primary schools using Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). In study 1, survey questionnaires were distributed to all principals from public primary schools in Hong Kong. Two hundred and sixty-six principals responded to the survey (response rate = 55.6%). In study 2, a follow-up interview study with 13 principals was conducted to further explore their perception of programming education. The results of study 1 indicated that principals with a better understanding of programming education tend to have clearer expectations of how to implement programming education in their schools, which consequently leads to greater support for the implementation of programming education. In study 2, the thematic analysis further supported the results obtained in study 1. Specifically, the results of study 2 demonstrated that most principals show understanding, expectation, and support for the implementation of programming education, which in turn results in various positive student and teacher outcomes. The results also showed that challenges are inevitable during implementation, principals show capabilities and willingness to adjust their expectation and support to better integrate programming education into their school curricula.;"[Kong, Siu-Cheung] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math & Informat Technol, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kong, Siu-Cheung; Wang, Yi-Qing] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Learning Teaching & Technol, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)";"Kong, SC (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math & Informat Technol, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Kong, SC (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Learning Teaching & Technol, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.";"sckong@eduhk.hk; pinkowang1989@gmail.com";"wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; Wang, Yahui/JCO-6233-2023; wang, yi/HOF-6668-2023";;Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust;Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust;The authors would like to acknowledge the funding support of this Coolthink@JC project from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust.;;76;5;7;9;86;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Understanding the Needs of Undergraduate Computer Science Students;ELECTRONICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"group programming; distributed collaborative programming; students' needs; COVID-19";;Collaborative learning activities have become a common practice in current university studies due to the implantation of the EHEA. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a radical and abrupt change in the teaching-learning model used in most universities, and in the way students' group work is carried out. Given this new situation, our interest is focused on discovering how computer science students have approached group programming tasks. For this purpose, we have designed a cross-sectional pilot study to explore, from both social and technological points of view, how students carried out their group programming activities during the shutdown of universities, how they are doing them now, when social distance must be maintained, and what they have missed in both situations. The results of the study indicate that during the imposed confinement, the students adopted a programming model based on work division or distributed peer programming, and very few made use of synchronous distributed collaboration tools. After the lockdown, the students mostly opted for a model based on collaborative programming and there was an increased use of synchronous distributed collaboration tools. The specific communication, synchronization, and coordination functionalities they considered most useful or necessary were also analyzed. Among the desirable features included in a software for synchronous distributed programming, the students considered that having an audio-channel can be very useful and, possibly, the most agile method to communicate. The video signal is not considered as very necessary, being in many cases rather a source of distraction, while textual communication through a chat, to which they are very accustomed, is also well valued. In addition, version control and the possibility of recovering previous states of the practical projects were highly appreciated by the students, and they considered it necessary to record the individual contributions of each member of the team to the result.;"[Lacave, Carmen; Molina, Ana Isabel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, CHICO Res Grp, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain";Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha;Lacave, C (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, CHICO Res Grp, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.;"carmen.lacave@uclm.es; anaisabel.molina@uclm.es";"Lacave, Carmen/AAF-6720-2021; Molina, Ana I/M-1392-2014";"Lacave, Carmen/0000-0003-2770-8482; Molina, Ana I/0000-0002-3449-2539";Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [TIN2015-66731-C2-2-R];Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness;This research was funded by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, and the European Grant Number TIN2015-66731-C2-2-R.;;30;2;2;1;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;JUL;2021;10;14;;;;;;;1728;10.3390/electronics10141728;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics10141728;;;17;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";TO1UX;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000676707000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is a preliminary step to add AI learning in a city-wide program consisting of elementary school students who learn computational thinking and digital literacy. Today children grow up in an age of AI which significantly affects how we live, work, and solve problems therefore AI should be taught in schools. Children usually employ AI models as black boxes without understanding the computational concepts, underlying assumptions, nor limitations of AI models. The hypothesis of this study is that to understand how machines learn, students should actively construct a neural network. To address this issue a dedicated curriculum and appropriate scaffolds were created for this study. It includes a programmable learning environment for elementary school students to construct AI agents.

SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system's intelligent nature.;"[Zhang, Tielin; Jia, Shuncheng; Cheng, Xiang; Xu, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci CASIA, Res Ctr Brain Inspired Intelligence, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tielin; Jia, Shuncheng; Cheng, Xiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci UCAS, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci UCAS, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Brain Sci & Intelligence Technol, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, CAS";"Zhang, TL; Xu, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci CASIA, Res Ctr Brain Inspired Intelligence, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.";"tielin.zhang@ia.ac.cn; xubo@ia.ac.cn";;"Zhang, Tielin/0000-0002-5111-9891; xu, bo/0000-0002-1111-1529; Cheng, Xiang/0000-0003-3246-7062";"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020AAA0104305]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61806195]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB32070100, XDA27010404]; Beijing Brain Science Project [Z181100001518006]";"National Key Research and Development Program of China(National Key Research & Development Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Beijing Brain Science Project";This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020AAA0104305, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61806195, in part by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDB32070100 and Grant XDA27010404, and in part by the Beijing Brain Science Project under Grant Z181100001518006.;;73;25;27;2;33;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2162-237X;2162-2388;;IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR;IEEE Trans.

Since the usage of the internet and other electronic tools for medical services delivery is at the initial stage, it is essential to examine the factors that condition patients and medical elements in a virtual environment can develop relationship models on the health services. So, the authors have systematically reviewed virtual medical learning and offered some suggestions for the upcoming works. The authors have also discovered gaps in the state-of-the-art papers and provided solutions for them. Design/methodology/approach Numerous novel advancements have changed the old exercise of therapeutic and analytic learning. Virtual spaces have quickly turned into a section of the learning technology vision. Given the importance of its achievements and endless low-cost expansion of the educational system, virtual education has been considered as one of the issues raised by the information communities. Medicine and health are some of the most important fields in virtual technologies. Hence, in this paper, we have used a systematic literature review to deeply examine virtual medical learning. After establishing exclusion and inclusion criteria, an independent systematic search in Google Scholar, ACM, Scopus, Eric, Science Direct, Springer link, Emerald, Global ProQuest and IEEE for relevant studies have been performed, and 21 papers have been analyzed. Detailed data have been mined out of the papers. Findings The authors have found that virtual medical learning improves and expands the knowledge core and meaningfully affects the exercise. Virtual learning (VL) has been used in many therapeutic zones, like therapeutic learning, surgery, diagnosing, combining and regularizing processes. It has presented a fundamental access point and a referral mechanism for all of a course's component communities. It can also simplify communicative education, allowing learners to get abilities before applying them in a real-world situation. Also, the communicative characteristics of different VL programs can somehow be like direct teaching. Research limitations/implications Some excellent work may be removed owing to applying the filters to select the primary papers. Surveying all the documents on the topic of virtual medical learning is impossible, too. Nevertheless, the authors have tried to present a perfect survey of virtual medical learning. The results will be helpful for scholars to propose better virtual medical learning techniques. Practical implications E-learning has become an indispensable additional learning tool in medical education. The introduction of new learning technologies, the exponential growth of Internet usage and the advent of the World Wide Web can change the face of higher education. The results will be helpful for scholars for the upcoming works. The application of a literature review of partial least squares theory was useful for offering comprehensive literary coverage and completing the knowledge development analysis. The authors have backed scholars and experts for better understanding the development of virtual medical learning systems via presenting comparative data and scrutinizing the present advances. Originality/value The paper enhances intellectual knowledge by improving the conception of virtual medical learning. It informs the development, use of virtual medical learning and the upcoming works. The lack of comprehensive papers in this field has increased the importance of this paper. The present paper can handle the pace of publications.;"[Tang, Mi; Zhou, Hongmei; Li, Ruoyu] Xihua Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Tang, Mi] Chengdu Sport Univ, Fac Sports Med, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Yan, Qingyan] Gen Hosp Western Theater Command, Oncol Dept, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hui] Dke Med Univ, Singapore, Singapore";"Xihua University; Chengdu Sport University";Li, RY (corresponding author), Xihua Univ, Sch Phys Educ, Chengdu, Peoples R China.;"mi22tang22@gmail.com; hhongmeizhou@gmail.cm; qingyanyan@aol.com; ruoyulli@aol.com; lu.uni100@gmail.com";Li, Roy/AAK-9800-2021;"Li, Roy/0000-0002-2145-7590; TANG, MI/0000-0002-8492-1573";"Soft Science Project of Science and Technology department of Sichuan province [2018ZR0186]; Innovation project of Sports Medicine and Health Research Institute of Chengdu Sport University [CX19D03]";"Soft Science Project of Science and Technology department of Sichuan province; Innovation project of Sports Medicine and Health Research Institute of Chengdu Sport University";"Supported by Soft Science Project of Science and Technology department of Sichuan province (2018ZR0186)< Research on the construction of extracurricular sports evaluation system for college students>, project leader: Ru;oyu Li.

However, there is a lack of work to support educators in making data-informed design decisions when designing a blended course and planning appropriate learning activities. In this paper, we introduce knowledge-based design analytics that uncover facets of the learning activities that are being created. A knowledge-based visualization is integrated into edCrumble, a (blended) learning design authoring tool. This new approach is explored in the context of a higher education programming course, where instructors design labs and home practice sessions with online smart learning content on a weekly basis. We performed a within-subjects user study to compare the use of the design tool both with and without visualization. We studied the differences in terms of cognitive load, controllability, confidence and ease of choice, design outcomes, and user actions within the system to compare both conditions with the objective of evaluating the impact of using design analytics during the decision-making phase of course design. Our results indicate that the use of a knowledge-based visualization allows the teachers to reduce the cognitive load (especially in terms of mental demand) and that it facilitates the choice of the most appropriate activities without affecting the overall design time. In conclusion, the use of knowledge-based design analytics improves the overall learning design quality and helps teachers avoid committing design errors.;"[Albo, Laia; Hernandez-Leo, Davinia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Barria-Pineda, Jordan; Brusilovsky, Peter] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, 135 N Benefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";"Pompeu Fabra University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh";Albó, L (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain.;"laia.albo@upf.edu; jab464@pitt.edu; peterb@pitt.edu; davinia.hernandez-leo@upf.edu";"Hernández-Leo, Davinia/C-2929-2011; Brusilovsky, Peter/AAJ-2440-2020; Albó, Laia/AAD-7779-2021";"Hernández-Leo, Davinia/0000-0003-0548-7455; Brusilovsky, Peter/0000-0002-1902-1464; Albó, Laia/0000-0002-7568-9178";"SEBAP, Societat Economica Barcelonesa d'Amics del Pais; NSF [DRL 1740775]; la Caixa Foundation (CoT project) [100010434]; FEDER, the National Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovations and Universities [MDM-2015-0502, TIN2014-53199-C3-3-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-3-R]; ICREA under the ICREA Academia programme; CONICYT [PFCHA/Doctorado Becas Chile/2018 -72190680]";"SEBAP, Societat Economica Barcelonesa d'Amics del Pais; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); la Caixa Foundation (CoT project); FEDER, the National Research Agency of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovations and Universities; ICREA under the ICREA Academia programme; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT))";This work is a result of a collaboration within a mobility grant for research funded by the SEBAP, Societat Economica Barcelonesa d'Amics del Pais.

This addictive behavior is more prevalent in young people, who can engage in long-term secondary inopportune outgrowths. The main aim of this study is to see whether self-control in Internet usage (SCIU) and mobile phone addiction (MPA) will mediate the relationship between physical fitness and subjective well-being (SWB) in a group of Chinese adults using IoT. 1801 university students completed the proposed standard scale grading assignments. The results of our analysis showed that SCIU directly mediated the relationship between physical exertion and SWB. MPA mediated the interaction between physical exercise and SWB in reverse. The results also showed that the multiple SCIU-MPA serial frameworks between physical exercise and SWB were statistically significant. This result indicates that SCIU and MPA's relationships may be unique mediators in the relationship between physical exercise and SWB. Understanding the underlying interactions may have therapeutic significance for chronic, neurobiological disorders in young people with MPA. These results may also be used to improve physical intervention programs to improve the well-being of young Chinese people.;"[Ding, Zhi-Chao; Yan, Jun; Fu, Jian] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China";Yangzhou University;Yan, J (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Coll Phys Educ, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;"dingzhichao@yzu.edu.cn; 007587@yzu.edu.cn; fujian@yzu.edu.cn";"WANG, YONGJIA/KFQ-4823-2024; zhong, jing/KBP-7800-2024";;Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Yangzhou University [XJ2019-14];Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Yangzhou University;This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Yangzhou University (grant no.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a new and emerging research area. Data mining techniques are used in the educational field in order to extract useful information on employee or student progress behaviors. Recent increase in the availability of learning data has given importance and momentum to educational data mining to better understand and optimize the learning process and the environments in which it takes place. Objective. Data are the most valuable commodity for any organization. It is very difficult to extract useful information from such a large and massive collection of data. Data mining techniques are used to forecast and evaluate academic performance of students based on their academic record and participation in the forum. Although several studies have been carried out to evaluate the academic performance of students worldwide, there is a lack of appropriate studies to assess factors that can boost the academic performance of students. Methodology. The current study sought to weigh up factors that contribute to improving student academic performance in Pakistan. In this paper, both the simple and parallel clustering techniques are implemented and analyzed to point out their best features. The Parallel K-Mean algorithms overcome the problems of simple algorithm and the outcomes of the parallel algorithms are always the same, which improves the cluster quality, number of iterations, and elapsed time. Results. Both the algorithms are tested and compared with each other for a dataset of 10,000 and 5000 integer data items. The datasets are evaluated 10 times for minimum elapse time-varying K value from 1 to 10. The proposed study is more useful for scientific research data sorting.

However, work remains to ensure that solutions are rigorous, valid, and reproducible. In this paper, we evaluate best practices for dissimilarity matrix calculation and clustering on mixed-type, clinical data. Methods: We simulate clinical data to represent problems in clinical trials, cohort studies, and EHR data, including single-type datasets (binary, continuous, categorical) and 4 data mixtures. We test 5 single distance metrics (Jaccard, Hamming, Gower, Manhattan, Euclidean) and 3 mixed distance metrics (DAISY, Supersom, and Mercator) with 3 clustering algorithms (hierarchical (HC), k-medoids, self-organizing maps (SOM)). We quantitatively and visually validate by Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and silhouette width (SW). We applied our best methods to two real-world data sets: (1) 21 features collected on 247 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and (2) 40 features collected on 6000 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Results: HC outperformed k-medoids and SOM by ARI across data types. DAISY produced the highest mean ARI for mixed data types for all mixtures except unbalanced mixtures dominated by continuous data. Compared to other methods, DAISY with HC uncovered superior, separable clusters in both real-world data sets. Discussion: Selecting an appropriate mixed-type metric allows the investigator to obtain optimal separation of patient clusters and get maximum use of their data. Superior metrics for mixed-type data handle multiple data types using multiple, type-focused distances. Better subclassification of disease opens avenues for targeted treatments, precision medicine, clinical decision support, and improved patient outcomes.;"[Coombes, Caitlin E.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, 370 W 9th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Liu, Xin; Coombes, Kevin R.; Brock, Guy] Ohio State Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, 1800 Cannon Dr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Abrams, Zachary B.] Washington Univ, Inst Informat, 444 Forest Pk Ave, St Louis, MO 63108 USA";"University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Washington University (WUSTL)";Coombes, CE (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, 370 W 9th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;"Caitlin.Coombes@osumc.edu; liu.7302@buckeyemail.osu.edu; Zachary.Abrams@osumc.edu; Kevin.Coombes@osumc.edu; Guy.Brock@osumc.edu";Coombes, Caitlin/AAT-3397-2021;"Liu, Xin/0000-0001-9278-9237; Coombes, Kevin/0000-0002-7630-2123";"Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR002733]";"Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS))";This work was partially supported by the Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) grant UL1TR002733.;;58;10;10;1;15;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1532-0464;1532-0480;;J BIOMED INFORM;J.

Presumably, the perspective of the students in understanding this study is crucial because students are key users of TSL systems and are faced with challenges in the adoption of such systems in learning institutions. We argue in the present study that predictors can be identified using Gestalts approach given the complex interactions between the organizational and individual factors. The extent of interaction between the factors was accomplished using the clustering algorithm. Data was collected from 184 students from Makerere and Gulu universities. Six clusters emerged out of the findings of which Cluster 4 students adopted TSL the most.

This has led to a variety of technology-driven pedagogies in e-teaching as well as e-learning. In order to take the best advantage, an appropriate understanding of the cognitive capability is of prime importance. This paper presents an intelligent cognitive maturity recognition system for confidence-based e-learning. We gather the data from actual test environment by involving a number of students and academicians to act as experts. Then a Genetic Programming based simulation and modeling is applied to generate a generalized classifier in the form of a mathematical expression. The simulation is derived towards an optimal space by carefully designed fitness function and assigning a range to each of the class labels. Experimental results validate that the proposed method yields comparative and superior results which makes it feasible to be used in real world scenarios.;"[Usman, Imran] Saudi Elect Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Alhomoud, Adeeb M.] Saudi Elect Univ, Coll Sci & Theoret Studies, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia";"Saudi Electronic University; Saudi Electronic University";Usman, I (corresponding author), Saudi Elect Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.;;ALHOMOUD, ADEEB/GQH-6304-2022;;Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at Saudi Electronic University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia;Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at Saudi Electronic University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia;The authors highly extend their appreciation and acknowledgement to the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at Saudi Electronic University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this work through the grant for the project titled Intelligent automated Cognitive-maturity recognition system for confidence based e-learning.;;16;0;0;0;6;INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS;SEOUL;DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA;1738-7906;;;INT J COMPUT SCI NET;Int.

J;Wang, FH;;;;Wang, Feng Hsu;;;Interpreting log data through the lens of learning design: Second-order predictors and their relations with learning outcomes in flipped classrooms;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Flipped classroom; Learning management systems; Online behavioral engagement; Exploratory factor analysis; Multiple linear regression";"1ST PRINCIPLES; ANALYTICS; PERFORMANCE; SUCCESS";Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS) have been widely adopted by educational institutions. However, earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models' predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.;[Wang, Feng Hsu] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan;Ming Chuan University;Wang, FH (corresponding author), Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;fhwang@mail.mcu.edu.tw;;;;;;;36;10;11;3;44;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Efforts have been made to develop strategies for managing clinician workload by improving patient assignment. The goal of the current study is to use electronic health record (EHR) data to predict the amount of work that individual patients contribute to clinician workload (patient-related workload). Methods: One month of EHR data was retrieved from an emergency department (ED). A list of workload indicators and five potential workload proxies were extracted from the data. Linear regression and four machine learning classification algorithms were utilized to model the relationship between the indicators and the proxies. Results: Linear regression proved that the indicators explained a substantial amount of variance of the proxies (four out of five proxies were modeled with R2 > 0.80). Classification algorithms also showed success in classifying a patient as having high or low task demand based on data from early in the ED visit (e.g. 80 % accurate binary classification with data from the first hour). Conclusion: The main contribution of this study is demonstrating the potential of using EHR data to predict patient-related workload automatically in the ED. The predicted workload can potentially help in managing clinician workload by supporting decisions around the assignment of new patients to providers. Future work should focus on identifying the relationship between workload proxies and actual workload, as well as improving prediction performance of regression and multi-class classification.;"[Wang, Xiaomei; Bisantz, Ann M.] Univ Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Blumenthal, H.

For the use-case of performing global computations over a graph, it is first ingested into a graph processing system from one of many digital representations. Extracting information from graphs involves processing all their elements globally, which can be done with single-machine systems (with varying approaches to hardware usage), distributed systems (either homogeneous or heterogeneous groups of machines) and systems dedicated to high-performance computing (HPC). For these systems focused on processing the bulk of graph elements, common use-cases consist in executing for example algorithms for vertex ranking or community detection, which produce insights on graph structure and relevance of their elements. Many distributed systems (such as Flink, Spark) and libraries (e.g. Gelly, GraphX) have been built to enable these tasks and improve performance. This is achieved with techniques ranging from classic load balancing (often geared to reduce communication overhead) to exploring trade-offs between delaying computation and relaxing accuracy. In this survey we firstly familiarize the reader with common graph datasets and applications in the world of today. We provide an overview of different aspects of the graph processing landscape and describe classes of systems based on a set of dimensions we describe. The dimensions we detail encompass paradigms to express graph processing, different types of systems to use, coordination and communication models in distributed graph processing, partitioning techniques and different definitions related to the potential for a graph to be updated. This survey is aimed at both the experienced software engineer or researcher as well as the graduate student looking for an understanding of the landscape of solutions (and their limitations) for graph processing.;"[Coimbra, Miguel E.; Francisco, Alexandre P.; Veiga, Luis] INESC ID, R Alves Redol 9, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal; [Coimbra, Miguel E.; Francisco, Alexandre P.; Veiga, Luis] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Av Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal";"INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa";"Coimbra, ME (corresponding author), INESC ID, R Alves Redol 9, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal.;Coimbra, ME (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Av Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.";miguel.e.coimbra@tecnico.ulisboa.pt;"Coimbra, Miguel/AAN-3199-2021; Veiga, Luís/AAM-2929-2020";"Coimbra, Miguel/0000-0002-7191-5895; Veiga, Luís/0000-0002-9285-0736; Francisco, Alexandre/0000-0003-4852-1641";"FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/EEI-COM/30644/2017, PTDC/CPO-CPO/28495/2017, PTDC/CCI-BIO/29676/2017, UIDB/50021/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/CCI-BIO/29676/2017, PTDC/EEI-COM/30644/2017, PTDC/CPO-CPO/28495/2017] Funding Source: FCT";"FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))";This work was partly supported by national funds through FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, under projects PTDC/EEI-COM/30644/2017, PTDC/CPO-CPO/28495/2017, PTDC/CCI-BIO/29676/2017 and UIDB/50021/2020.;;208;12;13;0;6;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2196-1115;;J BIG DATA-GER;J.

Abundant experiments are required to ensure that the students are sufficiently trained to get qualified practical skills and engineering abilities. The evaluation of abundant PLC experiments is a heavy and time-consuming task, and it is hard to grade an experiment result precisely and fairly. In this paper, a cloud-based automatic evaluation system for PLC experiments is accordingly proposed to deal with the above problems. Aliyun is employed to build the system platform. During experiments, client threads on the cloud will be scheduled to accesses the on-site S7-1500 PLCs through OLE for process control (OPC) UA protocol. Further, an innovative section-based experiment management method is proposed to make the system open, configurable, and thus extendable. The system relieves the hard work of the teachers on experiment evaluation and provides accurate evaluation conclusions. In contrast, the students can get more comprehensive feedback information and advice from the system to better understand the experiments and the behind principles. The cloud-based framework, the standard protocol as OPC UA, and the configurability of the system can be good references for other relevant systems.;"[Zhang, Shirong] Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Artificial Intelligence & Automat Dept, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Tang, Yuling] South Cent Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci, Automat Dept, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China";"Wuhan University; South Central Minzu University";Tang, YL (corresponding author), South Cent Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci, Automat Dept, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.;tylzsr@163.com;;;;;;;34;1;1;1;30;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

In this study, a new learning interactive method is proposed and evaluated using the experience of over 600 students of Mechanical Engineering. This study describes a 4-year experiment based on new interactive applications for education. The experiment has been implemented using E-learning techniques and new technologies (a combination of remote and virtual examples, videos, quizzes, and theory). Specifically, several applications have been programmed to be executed on different devices, such as mobile phones and PC/laptops (Android and Windows). The experiment is applied using small applications that help the students identify the most challenging contents and guide them throughout step-by-step. The main objective of this interactive method is to help students find their lack of knowledge and offer them contents to cover it. These didactic applications are portable and intuitive. Thanks to these interactive applications, it is possible to accomplish better practices of E-learning and Computer Simulation and Animation together. Since they are portable applications, they allow the student to interact and check conceptual understandings at any place. Students really appreciate this aspect.

We also examined how high and low performers differed in cognitive engagement levels when performing surface and deep learning behaviors. We found that students' facial behaviors were powerful predictors of their cognitive engagement states. In particular, we found that the SVM (Support Vector Machine) model demonstrated excellent capacity for distinguishing engaged and less engaged states when 17 informative facial features were added into the model. In addition, the results suggested that high performers did not differ significantly in the general level of cognitive engagement with low performers. There was also no difference in cognitive engagement levels between high and low performers when they performed shallow learning behaviors. However, high performers showed a significantly higher level of cognitive engagement than low performers when conducting deep learning behaviors.

The present research aimed to better understand and to assess the effectiveness of mobile learning in Science and Engineering Higher Education settings. The experience was carried out over two consecutive academic years, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, in a Polymer Technology course taught in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Bachelor programs. The Socrative online mobile platform enabled to conduct formative assessment through the use of multiple choice quizzes that were meticulously designed to facilitate understanding and to provide instant feedback. A three-way analysis of variance hypothesis test allowed concluding that Socrative had a significant effect, at the 0.05 level, on improving the students' average grade (about 1.5 points higher, on a scale of 0-10) in practical lab sessions as compared with a control group that did not participate in this type of methodology. Moreover, the results from an opinion survey revealed that Socrative enabled to achieve a meaningful learning of the fundamentals, made the everyday classrooms more engaging and fun, increased motivation, and, in general, helped create a more pleasant learning environment. The use of Socrative as an effective instrument that allowed minimizing learning disruptions as a consequence of the recent COVID-19 outbreak is also reported.;"[Roman, Claudia; Delgado, Miguel A.; Garcia-Morales, Moises] Univ Huelva, Dept Ingn Quim, Ctr Invest Tecnol Prod & Proc Quim Pro2TecS, Campus El Carmen, Huelva 21071, Spain";Universidad de Huelva;Roman, C (corresponding author), Univ Huelva, Dept Ingn Quim, Ctr Invest Tecnol Prod & Proc Quim Pro2TecS, Campus El Carmen, Huelva 21071, Spain.;claudia.roman@diq.uhu.es;"Roman, Claudia/O-5556-2014; García-Morales, Moisés/L-3720-2014; Canto, Miguel Angel Delgado/K-5311-2014";"Roman, Claudia/0000-0002-7960-5832; García-Morales, Moisés/0000-0003-4153-487X; Canto, Miguel Angel Delgado/0000-0003-0573-7987";Vicerrectorado de Innovacion y Empleabilidad de la Universidad de Huelva;Vicerrectorado de Innovacion y Empleabilidad de la Universidad de Huelva;Vicerrectorado de Innovacion y Empleabilidad de la Universidad de Huelva, Grant/Award Number: XXI Convocatoria de Proyectos de Innovacion;;28;7;8;2;38;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Learning styles in offline and online scenarios are recognized using questionnaires. The recent trend is to identify and use attributes to detect the learning style of the learner automatically without disturbing the learner. The paper is an extension of the authors' earlier work with some changes to the methodology. In this paper, the authors have identified new attributes and scaled-down the attributes identified earlier, which would help identify the learner's learning style. The authors implemented classification algorithms and compared the accuracy of the different algorithms on the dataset.

The objective of this study was to predict which patients were more likely to be in a complicated health condition at the time of admission to allow for the early introduction of medical interventions. The data were 644 electronic health records from Alsukari Hospital collected from January 2018 to April 2019. We used the following machine learning methods: logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). The logistic regression algorithm performed better than the other algorithms achieving an accuracy of 81%, recall of 81%, and F1 score of 75%. Also, attributes such as infection years, swelling, diabetic ketoacidosis, and diabetic septic foot were significant in predicting diabetes complications. This model can be useful for the identification of patients requiring additional care to limit the complications and help practitioners in making decisions on whether the patient should be hospitalized or sent home. Furthermore, we used the sequential feature selection (SFS) algorithm which reduced the features to six, which is fewer than any model built before to predict diabetes complications. The primary goal of this study was achieved. The model had fewer attributes which means we have a simple and understandable model in addition to, it has a better performance.;"[Abaker, Ali A.] Al Neelain Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Accounting Informat Syst, Khartoum, Sudan; [Saeed, Fakhreldeen A.] Al Neelain Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Software Engn, Khartoum, Sudan";;Abaker, AA (corresponding author), Al Neelain Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Dept Accounting Informat Syst, Khartoum, Sudan.;"aliabdallah@neelain.edu.sd; fasaeed@neelain.edu.sd";saeed, fakhreldin/J-6228-2012;saeed, fakhreldin/0000-0002-0024-983X;;;;;68;15;15;1;6;SLOVENSKO DRUSTVO INFORMATIKA;LJUBLJANA;VOZARSKI POT 12, LJUBLJANA, 1000, SLOVENIA;0350-5596;1854-3871;;INFORM-INT J COMPUT;Informatica;MAR;2021;45;1;;;;;117;125;;10.31449/inf.v45i1.3111;http://dx.doi.org/10.31449/inf.v45i1.3111;;;9;Computer Science, Software Engineering;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;YV0ZJ;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000752461700008;View Full Record in Web of Science

The Object Oriented (OO) paradigm includes objects related to real life, and is considered a natural domain that can be worked with. Nonetheless, mapping those real-life objects with basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts becomes a challenge for students to understand. Therefore, this study is concerned with designing and developing an SG prototype to overcome students' difficulties and misconceptions in learning OOP and achieving positive learning outcomes. An experimental evaluation was carried out to show the difference between the experimental group students' performance, who interact with the developed game, and students of the control group, who learn via the traditional instructional method. The experimental evaluations' main finding is that the experimental group's performance is better than the control group. The experimental group's Normalized Learning Gain (NLG) is significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.005, pairedt-test). The evaluation study results show that the developed prototype's perceived motivation on the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) 5-point Likert scale resulted in the highest mean score for attention (3.87) followed by relevance (3.66) subcategories. The results of this study show that the developed SG prototype is an effective tool in education, which improves learning outcomes and it has the potential to motivate students to learn OOP.;"[Abbasi, Suhni; Kazi, Hameedullah; Kazi, Ahmed Waliullah; Khowaja, Kamran; Baloch, Ahsanullah] Isra Univ, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Hyderabad 71000, Telangana, India; [Abbasi, Suhni] Sindh Agr Univ, Ctr Informat Technol, Hyderabad 70050, Telangana, India";;"Abbasi, S (corresponding author), Isra Univ, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Hyderabad 71000, Telangana, India.;Abbasi, S (corresponding author), Sindh Agr Univ, Ctr Informat Technol, Hyderabad 70050, Telangana, India.";"suhni.abbasi@sau.edu.pk; hkazi@isra.edu.pk; wali.kazi@isra.edu.pk; kamran.khowaja@isra.edu.pk; ahsanullah.baloch@isra.edu.pk";"Abbasi, Suhni/AGY-4465-2022; Khowaja, Kamran/A-5003-2014; Abbasi, Suhni/Q-9177-2017";"Abbasi, Suhni/0000-0002-6158-771X; Kazi, Hameedullah/0000-0002-5517-058X";Higher Education Commission of Pakistan [17-5/HEC/Sch-Ind/2012];Higher Education Commission of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan);The authors would like to acknowledge postgraduate grant, 17-5/HEC/Sch-Ind/2012 from the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.;;55;3;4;0;13;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2078-2489;;INFORMATION;Information;MAR;2021;12;3;;;;;;;101;10.3390/info12030101;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info12030101;;;21;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;RD8EW;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000633704900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Past research has demonstrated the capability of mobile sensing to model aspects of physical health, mental health, education, and work performance, etc. However, most of the algorithms and models proposed in previous work follow a one-size-fits-all (i.e., population modeling) approach that looks for common behaviors amongst all users, disregarding the fact that individuals can behave very differently, resulting in reduced model performance. Further, black-box models are often used that do not allow for interpretability and human behavior understanding. We present a new method to address the problems of personalized behavior classification and interpretability, and apply it to depression detection among college students. Inspired by the idea of collaborative-filtering, our method is a type of memory-based learning algorithm. It leverages the relevance of mobile-sensed behavior features among individuals to calculate personalized relevance weights, which are used to impute missing data and select features according to a specific modeling goal (e.g., whether the student has depressive symptoms) in different time epochs, i.e., times of the day and days of the week. It then compiles features from epochs using majority voting to obtain the final prediction. We apply our algorithm on a depression detection dataset collected from first-year college students with low data-missing rates and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning model by 5.1% in accuracy and 5.5% in F1 score. We further verify the pipeline-level generalizability of our approach by achieving similar results on a second dataset, with an average improvement of 3.4% across performance metrics. Beyond achieving better classification performance, our novel approach is further able to generate personalized interpretations of the models for each individual. These interpretations are supported by existing depression-related literature and can potentially inspire automated and personalized depression intervention design in the future.;"[Xu, Xuhai; Sefidgar, Yasaman S.; Nurius, Paula S.; Riskin, Eve; Dey, Anind K.; Mankoff, Jennifer] Univ Washington, 1410 NE Campus Pkwy, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chikersal, Prerna; Dutcher, Janine M.; Villalba, Daniella K.; Cohen, Sheldon; Creswell, Kasey G.; Creswell, J.

During the teaching process, a teacher needs to understand the difficulty of SPOC videos for students in real time to be more focused on the difficulties and key points of the course in a flipped classroom. However, existing educational data mining techniques pay little attention to the SPOC video difficulty clustering or classification. In this paper, we propose an approach to cluster SPOC videos based on the difficulty using video-watching data in a SPOC. Specifically, a bipartite graph that expresses the learning relationship between students and videos is constructed based on the number of video-watching times. Then, the SimRank++ algorithm is used to measure the similarity of the difficulty between any two videos. Finally, the spectral clustering algorithm is used to implement the video clustering based on the obtained similarity of difficulty. Experiments on a real data set in a SPOC show that the proposed approach has better clustering accuracy than other existing ones. This approach facilitates teachers learn about the overall difficulty of a SPOC video for students in real time, and therefore knowledge points can be explained more effectively in a flipped classroom.;"[Zhang, Feng; Liu, Di] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Liu, Cong] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China";"Shandong University of Science & Technology; Shandong University of Technology";Liu, C (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China.;liucongchina@sdut.edu.cn;;Liu, Cong/0000-0002-2665-7153;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61902222]; Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province [ts20190936, tsqn201909109]; Education Ministry Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Fund Project of China [19YJCZH240]; Qingdao social science planning research project [QD-SKL1901123]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province; Education Ministry Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Fund Project of China; Qingdao social science planning research project";This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61902222, the Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province under Grant ts20190936 and Grant tsqn201909109, the Education Ministry Humanities and Social Science Research Youth Fund Project of China (User-Steering Multi-Source Education Data Integration Approach Research in Big Data Environment under Grant 19YJCZH240), and the Qingdao social science planning research project under Grant QD-SKL1901123.;;28;2;2;2;31;IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS;TOKYO;KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN;1745-1361;;;IEICE T INF SYST;IEICE Trans.

The factors tested are the attention to higher education, absences, study time, parent's education level, parent's jobs, and the number of failures in the past. The result shows that only study time and absences can affect the students' performance. Prediction of student academic performance helps instructors develop a good understanding of how well or how poorly the students in their classes will perform, so instructors can take proactive measures to improve student learning.

The merits of the classical methods of problem-solving using only mathematics become much less superior to those linked with interactive graphics. In this study, an interactive educational LabVIEW program is designed to graphically simulate the constructional and mathematical procedures of the two widely used field methods in groundwater engineering, the Ernst auger-hole method, and the Bouwer-Rice slug test method, for field measurements of the hydraulic conductivity of soils below the water table. The simulations included the basic constructional steps in carrying out the auger hole and the slug test field methods. Virtual geometric wells, boreholes, and pipes are graphically and interactively designed to conduct the required field tests. The simulations of the program enabled the students to get acquainted with what should be done in the field to measure soil hydraulic conductivity and enhanced understanding of how to perform a field test. Students were able to try different field hydrological parameters, and by successively changing any hydrological field parameter, they were able to visualize graphically and interactively its influence inside the classroom. This particular step improved the student's practical standards. Conditions of validity of each field test are completely fulfilled by the program. Results of the interactive program are found to be visually interesting and extremely accurate, which made this educational program quite interesting in teaching and learning.;[Allawi, Faridoun A.

For more meaningful learning, the use of a graphic tool instead of programming provides more insight into those concepts throughout a simple and practical resource. Taking this into account, a software tool has been developed in addition to theoretical sessions in the context of a subject of the Degree in Computer Science, where the learning objectives are related to the representation and compression of multimedia content. In addition, this tool allows to configure useful exercises for these practical sessions, such that students can experiment and analyse the results from a visual perspective. The results of the surveys show a high degree of satisfaction of students, who highlight that the tool has helped them to better understand the curriculum content. In addition, there are signs of improvement in the academic results corresponding to the evaluation of performance with such software.;"[Fresnedo, Oscar; Laport, Francisco; Castro, Paula M.; Dapena, Adriana] Univ A Coruna, CITIC Res Ctr, Dept Comp Engn, La Coruna, Spain";Universidade da Coruna;"Fresnedo, O (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Dept Comp Engn, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15007, Spain.;Fresnedo, O (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, CITIC Res Ctr, Campus Elvina S-N, La Coruna 15007, Spain.";oscar.fresnedo@udc.es;"Castro-Castro, Paula-Maria/M-8213-2015; castro, paula/KEE-9494-2024; Fresnedo, Óscar/AAC-4007-2020; Dapena, Adriana/L-8562-2018";"Castro-Castro, Paula-Maria/0000-0002-0521-3465; Fresnedo, Óscar/0000-0002-2905-9052; Dapena, Adriana/0000-0001-7362-6854";"Xunta de Galicia [ED431G2019/01]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain [TEC2016-75067-C4-1-R]; ERDF funds of the EU (AEI/FEDER, UE); European Social Fund of the European Union [ED481A-2018/156]";"Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Spain(Spanish Government); ERDF funds of the EU (AEI/FEDER, UE); European Social Fund of the European Union";The authors belong to the teaching innovation group MATEES at the University of A Coruna.

Recently, due to the introduction of Microsoft Kinect, many skeleton-based human action understanding frameworks have been proposed. In this work, we propose a novel method to cluster the quality of complicated human actions towards contactless operative video reading system (COVRS). More specifically, we first extract the skeleton by leveraging the Kinect, which is subsequently fed into an aggregation deep neural network to extract the deep feature for each human action skeleton. In COVRS, the human hand gesture is an informative clue. Thus, we propose a ranking algorithm to extract the position of human five figures, based on which the deep hand gesture representation is hierarchically learned. Noticeably, it is observable that, the acoustic feature from many human activities also contributes to the quality assessment. We extract multiple acoustic features from the audio associated with each human activity video. Finally, based on the above human skeleton and hand gesture deep features, as well as the shallow acoustic features, we employ a probabilistic model to integrate them for clustering the various human activities using the quality of COVRS. Comprehensive experimental have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Besides, empirical results have shown that our probabilistic quality model is highly extensible, where additionally visual/acoustic features can be encoded according to different applications.

A short-term e-marketing education program for a variety of students was introduced in May 2020 and is taught entirely online. A survey was conducted regularly in the last week of training using Google Forms, and three cohorts were surveyed in July, September, and December 2020. A high level of satisfaction indicates an interest in the content and a positive assessment of the level of comfort of an organization adapted to the needs of students; this positive result contrasted with the negative opinion of the remote learning in Russia since March 2020, and this surprising satisfaction of students has motivated the study to try to explain its reasons. This result was compared with the short-term course taught through the educational pedagogical platform of a university. The students of traditional short- and long-term university programs were asked to assess their satisfaction with different digital communication tools used for e-learning. They showed low satisfaction with the pedagogical platform and a positive reaction to the e-communication tools (messengers, social media, short surveys, video conferences, etc.). The qualitative responses helped to better understand the real problems of the cognitive process and the triple structure of intellectual production during e-learning, including interest in the intellectual outcome, the need for emotional and motivational elements of cooperation and competition between students, and smooth behavioral enrichment, which requires special efforts from students and their leading from teachers. The main conclusion concerns a practical decision to continue the implementation of the educational program in the form of an online course with the use of the mixed digital communication tools of social media, messengers, and video conferences, which most likely meets the expectations and capabilities of students.";"[Pokrovskaia, Nadezhda N.; Leontyeva, Veronika L.; Ababkova, Marianna Yu] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Higher Sch Media Commun & Publ Relat, Inst Humanities, St Petersburg 195251, Russia; [Pokrovskaia, Nadezhda N.] Herzen State Pedag Univ Russia, Dept Publ Relat & Advertising, Inst Human Philosophy, St Petersburg 191186, Russia; [Pokrovskaia, Nadezhda N.] St Petersburg Electrotech Univ LETI, Dept Innovat Management, St Petersburg 197022, Russia; [Cappelli, Lucio] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, Italy; [Cappelli, Lucio; D'Ascenzo, Fabrizio] Sapienza Univ, Fac Econ, I-00185 Rome, Italy";"Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia; Saint Petersburg State Electrotechnical University; University of Cassino; Sapienza University Rome";"Pokrovskaia, NN (corresponding author), Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Higher Sch Media Commun & Publ Relat, Inst Humanities, St Petersburg 195251, Russia.;Pokrovskaia, NN (corresponding author), Herzen State Pedag Univ Russia, Dept Publ Relat & Advertising, Inst Human Philosophy, St Petersburg 191186, Russia.;Pokrovskaia, NN (corresponding author), St Petersburg Electrotech Univ LETI, Dept Innovat Management, St Petersburg 197022, Russia.";"nnp@spbstu.ru; leontieva_vl@spbstu.ru; ababkova_myu@spbstu.ru; lucio.cappelli@uniroma1.it; fabrizio.dascenzo@uniroma1.it";"Ababkova, Marianna Yurevna/B-8350-2018; Pokrovskaia, Nadezhda/M-4586-2016";"Ababkova, Marianna Yurevna/0000-0002-6589-8523; Pokrovskaia, Nadezhda/0000-0002-0795-8102; D'ASCENZO, FABRIZIO/0000-0001-7627-265X";"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-29-12965/18]";"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government)";This paper was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation on the program to improve the competitiveness of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU) among the world's leading research and education centers in 2016-2020.

However, they are still limited for supporting marking descriptive mathematical answers that can best evaluate learners' understanding. This paper presents clustering of offline handwritten mathematical expressions (HMEs) to help teachers efficiently mark answers in the form of HMEs. In this work, we investigate a method of combining feature types from low-level directional features and multiple levels of recognition: bag-of-symbols, bag-of-relations, and bag-ofpositions. Moreover, we propose a marking cost function to measure the marking effort. To show the effectiveness of our method, we used two datasets and another sampled from CROHME 2016 with synthesized patterns to prepare correct answers and incorrect answers for each question. In experiments, we employed the k-means++ algorithm for each level of features and considered their combination to produce better performance. The experiments show that the best combination of all the feature types can reduce the marking cost to about 0.6 by setting the number of answer clusters appropriately compared with the manual one-by-one marking.;"[Vu-Tran-Minh Khuong; Khanh-Minh Phan; Huy-Quang Ung; Cuong-Tuan Nguyen; Nakagawa, Masaki] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fuchu, Tokyo 1808585, Japan";Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology;Nakagawa, M (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Fuchu, Tokyo 1808585, Japan.;nakagawa@cc.tuat.ac.jp;"Nguyễn, Cường/JDV-5253-2023; PHAN, KHANH M/U-5822-2018; Nguyen, Cuong Tuan/Q-5640-2017; UNG, Huy QUANG/AAR-5507-2021; Nguyen, Cuong Tuan/JGE-2491-2023";"UNG, Huy QUANG/0000-0001-9238-8601; Nguyen, Cuong Tuan/0000-0003-2556-9191";"[19H01117]; [18K18068]";";";This work was partially supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A)-19H01117 and WAKATE (B)-18K18068.

As in other technical subjects, practical experiments really help to understand the theory but need much time and the experimental platforms are usually expensive. This paper describes a platform that implements a universal third-order discrete controller based on field programmable gate array (FPGA). The controller is implemented using fixed-point arithmetic, with 17-bit coefficients, but students can reduce the number of bits to find the resolution problems that may arise. This low-cost platform, based on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA, allows students to try controllers just by configuring the coefficients of the controller through a computer application and a USB port. It drastically reduces the implementation time, allowing more time for design and testing. Therefore, students can try many controllers in the same laboratory session so that they can check experimentally their behavior in real prototypes and see the differences between simulations and physical systems. This platform has been applied in a real course over two academic years. The student opinion survey shows that the survey respondents consider the platform useful for more deeply understanding the subject, with an average score of 4.47/5.00 on a Likert scale (with a margin of error of 15.56% with a 95% confidence level).

However, the supporting literature lacks robust methodology and is conflicting in demonstrating efficacy outcomes. Contrastingly, near-peer teaching (where senior students teach juniors on the same academic programme) is well researched and reported to be both effective and versatile. This provides an ideal vehicle in which to investigate and potentially optimise these approaches. This study aims to assess educational impact of the peer-led flipped model and student engagement and perceptions regarding traditional and TEL resources. A quasi-randomised, cross-sectional study was conducted with 281 second-year University of Southampton medical students. Students were randomly allocated to 3 groups: traditional lecture (control), flipped text resource, or flipped video resource. The first group received no pre-teaching material, but the flipped groups received a text or video pre-teaching resource. Objective outcomes measured were: Knowledge gain and retention via multiple-choice questionnaires and formative exams Student perceptions and engagement using questionnaires and 2 focus groups All groups demonstrated significant knowledge gain post-teaching (p < 0.0001). However, regardless of engagement with pre-teaching material, no significant difference was found in knowledge gain or retention between the groups. Students engaged 21.1% more with the text rather than video resource (p = 0.0019), but spent equal time using both (p = 0.0948). All resources and teaching approaches were perceived 'very useful' with no significant differences found between groups. A qualitative approach utilising thematic analysis of focus groups identified 4 themes, including 'Attitudes towards flipped classroom', which revealed mixed reviews and perceptions from participants. This study has found the peer-led flipped model is of no detriment to educational impact compared to peer-led traditional approaches in a well-established peer teaching programme in undergraduate medicine at the University of Southampton. Students value traditional and video resources but engage with them differently. Additionally, it was reported that in this experiment, NPT did not seem well suited to the flipped classroom, suggesting a rare limitation of the utility of NPT application within an anatomy curriculum.;"[Anbu, Deepika; Robson, Alistair; Kurn, Octavia; Taylor, Charles; Dean, Oliver; Payne, December; Nagy, Eva; Border, Scott] Univ Southampton, Fac Med, Southampton, Hants, England; [Harrison, Charlotte] Oxford Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Oxford, England; [Hall, Samuel] Univ Hosp Southampton NHS Fdn Trust, Southampton, Hants, England";"University of Southampton; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; University of Southampton; University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust";Border, S (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Fac Med, Southampton, Hants, England.;border@soton.ac.uk;;"Hall, Samuel/0000-0002-7335-6636; Anbu, Deepika/0000-0001-7430-9535";;;;;59;2;2;0;12;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0065-2598;2214-8019;"978-3-030-76951-2; 978-3-030-76950-5";ADV EXP MED BIOL;Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.;;2021;1334;;;;;;1;22;;10.1007/978-3-030-76951-2_1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76951-2_1;10.1007/978-3-030-76951-2;;22;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Biomedical; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology";"Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)";"Computer Science; Education & Educational Research; Engineering; Research & Experimental Medicine; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology";BS2MG;34476742;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000703713800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The platform enables the creation of multiple unique programming scenarios with variability in complexity without any hardware changes. Prior experimental hardware comes with static programming facilities that focus the students' learning on hardware features and programming basics, leaving them ill-equipped to take up practical applications with more real-time constraints. This hardware complements and completes their learning to help them program real-world embedded systems. The hardware uses LEDs to simulate the movement of trains in a network. The network has train stations, intersections and parking slots where the train movements can be controlled by using a 16-bit Renesas RL78/G13 microcontroller. Additionally, simulating facilities are provided to enable the students to navigate the trains by manual controls using switches and indicators. This helps them get an easy understanding of train navigation functions before taking up programming. The students start with simple tasks and gradually progress to more complicated ones with real-time constraints, on their own. During training, students' learning outcomes are evaluated by obtaining their feedback and conducting a test at the end to measure their knowledge acquisition during the training. Students' Knowledge Enhancement Index is originated to measure the knowledge acquired by the students. It is observed that 87% of students have successfully enhanced their knowledge undergoing training with this rail-network simulator.;"[Balaji, M.] Frontline Elect Pvt Ltd, Salem 636016, Tamil Nadu, India; [Chandrasekaran, M.] Govt Coll Engn, Elect & Commun Engn, Bargur 635104, Tamil Nadu, India; [Dhandapani, Vaithiyanathan] Natl Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, New Delhi 110040, Ncr, India";"National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Delhi";Balaji, M (corresponding author), Frontline Elect Pvt Ltd, Salem 636016, Tamil Nadu, India.;"feplbalaji@gmail.com; drmcs123@yahoo.com; dvaithiyanathan@nitdelhi.ac.in";Dhandapani, Vaithiyanathan/Y-7016-2019;"Dhandapani, Vaithiyanathan/0000-0001-5235-2620; M, Dr.Chandrasekaran/0000-0002-2939-1856; Balaji, Munusamy/0000-0002-5069-9337";;;;;20;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9292;;ELECTRONICS-SWITZ;Electronics;JAN;2021;10;1;;;;;;;13;10.3390/electronics10010013;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics10010013;;;14;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Physics";PP3US;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000605792000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we applied the second generation of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model and partial least-squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to fill this research gap. We recruited 187 undergraduate participants from the Data Science course at Feng Chia University (FCU), Taiwan, in the spring semester of 2021. Our results showed that 'hedonic motivation', 'self-efficacy', and 'social influence' had the most significant positive effects on students' intention to use the OJ system. Interestingly, academic majors did not play a significant moderating role between the intention to use the OJ system and other influential factors. However, it exerted a significant direct effect on 'behavioral intention'.

In the course of curriculum setting in many colleges and universities, more and more attention is paid to the teaching of computer courses for college students. In the course of setting up and teaching, we still follow the traditional teaching mode and do not pay more attention to students' practical practice. By observing the computer course materials selected by many colleges and universities for students, we can see that most of the textbooks still focus on arranging some exercises from the point of view that science and engineering are students, and lack the basic knowledge of the curriculum. Because the understanding and research of computer course is not deep enough, the teaching effect obtained since the course is not ideal. By studying the relevant knowledge of machine learning and some important problems in the development of neural network algorithm theory, this paper puts forward some viewpoints based on the current curriculum system in colleges and universities in order to improve the learning quality of computer courses.

In particular, as feedback provided by students is essential for determining the quality and direction of classes, instructors should interact with students who are currently participating in classes by exchanging feedback. This paper proposes a block editing model that can reflect student feedback. The block editing model is an interactive e-textbook editing model that is dynamically updated based on the feedback provided by students in real time without modifying the structure of digital textbooks. In particular, in order for even non-developers who do not know web programming languages to be able to produce interactive digital textbooks easily, the authors developed an editor that could help implement them based on Blockly, a visual programming language.

Instead, new and developing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are emerging as a promising paradigm for creating a profound change in digitizing education. It facilitates active learning with the enhancement in its delivery and how students grasp it by representing the shift from traditional desktop-as-a-platform towards the network-as-a-platform model. This paper proposes an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with ICT-based teaching and learning platform. TAM is the fundamental model to understand user perceptions and behavior towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. A mixed research methodology is adopted, comprising a series of survey questionnaires, evaluation of results, and the undergraduate student's performance in the collection of quantitative and qualitative data to measure the acceptance of the proposed research model. For the practical implication of the proposed research model, four groups of 300 students each or two programming courses: C++ and Java, were analyzed in two consecutive academic sessions in a controlled environment for lecture and laboratory classes. Series of statistical result analyses were performed and examined with hypothesized relationships to measure the desired outcome. It measures the impact on the following constructs: student interest, motivation, understanding, satisfaction, class attention and interaction, attendance, improve grades, and perception of pedagogical effect. Results show positive effects for identified research questions and hypotheses, helping students with the knowledge, understanding, and deep learning programming and debugging skills. The novelty of this research lies in extending the findings using real-time monitoring facilities to track student activities and progress, including frequency use and intention to use a technologically driven learning style.

Based on these patterns, we can make targeted rules, especially for unexpected patterns. To perform this type of work, a questionnaire method is usually used to collect data and analyze students' behavioral states. However, the effectiveness of this method is greatly influenced by the timeliness and validity of the feedback data. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised ensemble clustering framework to use student behavioral data to discover behavioral patterns. Because the behavioral data produced by students on campus are available in real time without intentional bias, clustering analysis can be relatively efficient and reliable. The proposed framework extracts behavior features from the two perspectives of statistics and entropy and then combines density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and k-means algorithms to discover behavioral patterns. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we carry out experiments on six types of behavioral data produced by undergraduates in a university in Beijing and analyze the relationships between different behavioral patterns and students' grade point averages (GPAs). The results show that the framework can not only detect anomalous behavioral patterns but also find mainstream patterns.

Most data used for learning analytics research comes from learning management systems. However, such systems were not developed to support learning programming. Therefore, educators have to resort to other systems that support the programming process, which can pose a challenge when it comes to understanding students' learning since it takes place in different contexts. Methods that support the combination of different data sources are needed. Such methods would ideally account for the time-ordered sequence of students' learning actions. In this article, we use a novel method (multi-channel sequence mining with Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) that allows the combination of multiple data sources, accounts for the temporal nature of students' learning actions, and maps the transitions between different learning tactics. Our study included 291 students enrolled in a higher education programming course. Students' trace-log data were collected from the learning management system and from a programming automated assessment tool. Data were analyzed using multi-channel sequence mining and HMM. The results reveal different patterns of students' approaches to learning programming. High achievers start earlier to work on the programming assignments, use more independent strategies and consume learning resources more frequently, while the low achievers procrastinate early in the course and rely on help forums. Our findings demonstrate the potentials of multi-channel sequence mining and how this method can be analyzed using HMM. Furthermore, the results obtained can be of use for educators to understand students' strategies when learning programming.;"[Lopez-Pernas, Sonsoles] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Sistemas Informat, Dept Sistemas Informat, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Saqr, Mohammed] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Comp, Joensuu 80101, Finland";"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Eastern Finland";Saqr, M (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Comp, Joensuu 80101, Finland.;mohammed.saqr@uef.fi;"Saqr, Mohammed/AAH-2520-2020; López-Pernas, Sonsoles/M-7375-2019";"Saqr, Mohammed/0000-0001-5881-3109; López-Pernas, Sonsoles/0000-0002-9621-1392";;;;;47;12;12;1;21;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2021;9;;;;;;166531;166541;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3134844;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3134844;;;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";XU0AO;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000733939500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Machine Learning is a major sub-domain of artificial intelligence, where it has become one of the most promising fields in computer science. In recent years, there is a large spectrum of healthcare and biomedical data that has been growing intensely. Due to the huge labeled or unlabeled data, it is important to have a compact and robust machine learning solution for classification. Several optimizers have been deployed to improve the inclusive performance of machine learning models. The classification of machine learning models depends on several factors. This comprehensive review paper aims to insight into the current stage of optimized machine learning success on medical data classification. An increasing number of unstructured medical data has been utilizing in machine learning algorithms to predict intuitions. But it is difficult to inherent immense intuition from those data. So machine learning researchers have utilized state-of-art optimizers and novel feature selection techniques to overcome and emend the performance accuracy. We have highlighted some recent literature, which exhibits the robust impact of optimizers and feature selection on machine learning techniques on medical data characterization.

The motivation of this study is the possibility to extend the understanding of the extra predictive power of Google search engine query volume of future housing price change (shift direction) by (i) the introduction of a research approach that combines the advantages of the complementary use of cross-correlation analysis and machine learning classification algorithms; (ii) applying the multi-class HPI values classifier which allows predicting the housing price increase, decrease or relative stability; (iii) exploiting the SVI that relates to interests in both 'real estate' and 'credit to buy real estate'; (iv) evaluation of the introduced approach in the context of the Polish real estate market. The main theoretical contribution of our work is a confirmation that the freely available information regarding Google user searches can provide an in-depth insight into enriching the generally accepted statistics on supply and demand in the real estate market. From the practical perspective, this research confirms that SVI can be associated as a sole determinant to anticipate the housing price change with time-lag sufficient for making decisions regarding the purchase (sale) of individual property or the real estate market control.

The opacity of these models is one of the problems with their use. Prediction models that may offer valuable insights while still being simple to comprehend are preferred by decision-makers in education. Hence, this study suggests an approach that improves the previous student performance prediction by enhancing performance and explaining why a student's performance is attaining a certain score. A prediction model was proposed and tested using machine learning models. Our models outperform previous work models developed on the same dataset. Using a combined framework of data level and algorithm approaches, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of over 98%, inplying a 20.3% improvement compared with previous work models. As a balancing technique for upsampling data, we use the default strategy of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to oversample all classes to the number of examples in the majority class. We also use ensemble methods. For tuning the parameters, we use a simple grid search algorithm provided by scikit to estimate the optimal parameters of our model. This hyperparameter optimization along with a ten-fold cross-validation process demonstrates the dependability of the novel model. In addition, a novel visual and intuitive technique is used to help determine which factors most influence the score which helps to interpret and understand the entire model and visualizes feature attributions at the observation level for the machine learning model. Therefore, SHAP values are a powerful tool that should be incorporated within the student performance prediction framework by obtaining the prediction and explanation created through the experiment, educators can recognize students at risk early and provide suitable exhortation in an auspicious manner.;"[Sahlaoui, Hayat; Agoujil, Said] Univ Moulay Ismail, Fac Sci & Tech Errachidia, Dept Comp Sci, Meknes 52000, Errachidia, Morocco; [Alaoui, El Arbi Abdellaoui] Univ Moulay Ismail, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Sci, Meknes 52000, Morocco; [Nayyar, Anand] Duy Tan Univ, Grad Sch, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Nayyar, Anand] Duy Tan Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Da Nang 550003, Vietnam; [Jaber, Mustafa Musa] Al Turath Univ Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Baghdad 10021, Iraq; [Jaber, Mustafa Musa] Dijlah Univ Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Baghdad 10021, Iraq";"Moulay Ismail University of Meknes; Moulay Ismail University of Meknes; Duy Tan University; Duy Tan University";"Nayyar, A (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Grad Sch, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.;Nayyar, A (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Da Nang 550003, Vietnam.;Jaber, MM (corresponding author), Al Turath Univ Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Baghdad 10021, Iraq.;Jaber, MM (corresponding author), Dijlah Univ Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Baghdad 10021, Iraq.";"anandnayyar@duytan.edu.vn; mmjh86@gmail.com";"Jaber, Mustafa Musa/E-1108-2019; Nayyar, Anand/F-3732-2015";"Jaber, Mustafa Musa/0000-0002-5777-9428; Nayyar, Anand/0000-0002-9821-6146; Abdellaoui Alaoui, El Arbi/0000-0002-5387-9819";;;;;59;15;16;3;32;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2021;9;;;;;;152688;152703;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124270;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124270;;;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";XC4LF;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000721985500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, more research is needed to better understand how to help elementary school students acquire CT skills effectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (PPP) on elementary school students' CT skills and self-efficacy (SE). The study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled Computational Thinking with Scratch with the same teacher for one semester. Two classes (84 students) were in the Experimental Group (EG, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the Control Group (CG, 45 boys and 42 girls). The students in the EG were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the CG did the assignments on their own. The results showed that the students in the EG improved their CT skills and SE more significantly than those in the CG group. There was a low correlation between CT and SE in the post-test of both groups. The interviews with the teacher and the students afterwards provided insights in understanding the results. The findings suggest that in K-12 programming teachers could use PPP as an effective approach to improve students' CT skills, programming SE, and beyond.;"[Wei, Xuefeng] Ludong Univ, Sch Teacher Educ, 186 Hongqi Rd, Yantai, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lin; Meng, Nanxi] Univ North Texas, Dept Learning Technol, 3940 North Elm St, Denton, TX 76207 USA; [Tan, Wei] Expt Primary Sch Yantai Econ & Technol Dev Area, Xiaoqinghe Rd, Yantai, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Kong, Siu-Cheung] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Learning Teaching & Technol, Tai Po, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kinshuk] Univ North Texas, Coll Informat, 3940 North Elm St, Denton, TX 76207 USA";"Ludong University; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton";Wei, XF (corresponding author), Ludong Univ, Sch Teacher Educ, 186 Hongqi Rd, Yantai, Shandong, Peoples R China.;"xuefengwei99@163.com; Lin.Lin@unt.edu; nanxi.meng@unt.edu; tanweildu@163.com; sckong@eduhk.hk; kinshuk@unt.edu";tan, wei/HFZ-9071-2022;Lipsmeyer, Lin Lin/0000-0002-9630-9744;National Social Science Foundation of China Research on the Evaluation System of individualization-oriented Internet Education Services in Primary and Middle Schools [BCA170075];National Social Science Foundation of China Research on the Evaluation System of individualization-oriented Internet Education Services in Primary and Middle Schools;This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China Research on the Evaluation System of individualization-oriented Internet Education Services in Primary and Middle Schools (NO: BCA170075).;;70;95;97;39;273;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Virtual Reality Training (VRT) as a training tool for example, expresses potential capabilities to improve the learning curve, increasing trainee confidence and acquisition of skills. However, the success of this tool highly depends on how close this tool is to the reality. Ontology is called as a significant modelling tool which can help to provide a shared and common understanding of a domain, and in this scenario, a standardized terminology for representing the training domain, and actions taking place in Virtual Environment (VE). Recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) findings show that most ontology designs for VRT are not built systematically and there is no ontology describing the domain knowledge for VRT in the ophthalmology field. There is also a lack of a high achievement rate in implementing ontology driven VRT, calls for systematic and comprehensive steps. Therefore, in order to lower the failure rate of ontology applied to VRT, OntoPhaco was designed and developed based on philosophically grounded foundational ontologies, namely, Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The evaluation results showed that the use of OntoPhaco was able to improve the student's learning experience, assist effectively in building VR training scenarios, and lead to a successful VRT processes. The lessons learnt from designing OntoPhaco for this domain could generally generate valuable contribution to the theory and practice of VRT, knowledge management and ontology engineering in complex domains.;"[Youcef, Benferdia; Ahmad, Mohammad Nazir] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst IR4 0, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mustapha, Mushawiahti] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia UKM, Dept Ophthalmol, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia";"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia";Mustapha, M (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia UKM, Dept Ophthalmol, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;drmusha@gmail.com;"Benferdia, Youcef/HKO-3719-2023; AHMAD, Mohammad Nazir/AAU-7449-2020";"AHMAD, Mohammad Nazir/0000-0003-3639-1157; Benferdia, Youcef/0000-0002-7827-6635";"Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE); Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) [TRGS/1/2020/UKM/02/6/2]";"Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE); Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)";This work was supported by Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), under Grant TRGS/1/2020/UKM/02/6/2.;;68;3;3;1;9;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2021;9;;;;;;152347;152378;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126697;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126697;;;32;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";XA2UU;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000720509500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, it has certain difficulties in the classification of student sentiments. Based on this, this paper analyzes the student sentiment classification model by neural network algorithm and uses the student group as an example to explore the application of neural network model in sentiment classification. Moreover, the regularization method is added to the loss function of LSTM so that the output at any time is related to the output at the previous time. In addition, the sentimental drift distribution of sentimental words on each sentimental label is added to the regularizer, and the sentimental information is merged with the two-way LSTM to allow the model to choose forward or reverse. Finally, in order to verify the research model, the performance of the model proposed in this paper is studied through experimental research. The research shows that the model proposed in this paper has better comprehensive performance than the traditional model and can meet the actual needs of students' sentiment classification.;"[Yu, Hailong; Ji, Yannan; Li, Qinglin] Chengde Med Coll, Chengde, Hebei, Peoples R China";Chengde Medical University;Yu, HL (corresponding author), Chengde Med Coll, Chengde, Hebei, Peoples R China.;yuhailong198237@126.com;;;Research on social science development in Chengde in 2018Research on the innovation of ideological and political education in colleges and universities in chengde area [20182065];Research on social science development in Chengde in 2018Research on the innovation of ideological and political education in colleges and universities in chengde area;Research on social science development in Chengde in 2018Research on the innovation of ideological and political education in colleges and universities in chengde area(project number: 20182065 general project).;;21;5;5;6;34;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1064-1246;1875-8967;;J INTELL FUZZY SYST;J.

Introducing software engineering principles into end-user programming could improve the quality of the developed software applications. For example, model-driven development improves technology independence and adaptive systems act upon changes in their context of use. However, end-users need to apply such principles in a non-daunting manner and without incurring a steep learning curve. This paper presents EUD-MARS that aims to provide end-users with a simple approach for developing model-driven adaptive robotics software. End-users include people like hobbyists and students who are not professional programmers but are interested in programming robots. EUD-MARS supports robots like hobby drones and educational humanoids that are available for end-users. It offers a tool for software developers and another one for end-users. We evaluated EUD-MARS from three perspectives. First, we used EUD-MARS to program different types of robots and assessed its visual programming language against existing design principles. Second, we asked software developers to use EUD-MARS to configure robots and obtained their feedback on strengths and points for improvement. Third, we observed how end-users explain and develop EUD-MARS programs, and obtained their feedback mainly on understandability, ease of programming, and desirability. These evaluations yielded positive indications of EUD-MARS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, current mobility models often do not reflect the realistic movements of users within their environments. They also do not provide the freedom to adjust their degrees of randomness or adequately mimic human movements by injecting possible crossing points and adding recurrent patterns. In this paper, we propose the recurrent self-similar Gauss-Markov mobility (RSSGM) model, a novel mobility model that is suitable for applications in which nodes exhibit recurrent visits to selected locations with semi-similar routes. Examples of such applications include daily human routines, airplane and public transportation routes, and intra-campus student walks. First, we present the proposed algorithm and its assumptions, and then we study its behavior in different scenarios. The study's results show that different and more realistic mobility traces can be achieved without the need for complex computational models or existing GPS records. Our model can flexibly adjust its behavior to fit any application by carefully tuning and choosing the right values for its parameters.;"[Alenazi, Mohammed J.

Even more, with the current acceleration because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more learning processes are becoming online and are incorporating technologies related to automatize assessment or help instructors in the process. While we are in an initial stage of that integration, it is the moment to reflect on the students' perceptions of being assessed by a non-conscious software entity like a machine learning model or any other artificial intelligence application. As a result of the paper, we present a TAM-based model and a ready-to-use instrument based on five aspects concerning understanding technology adoption like the Al-based assessment on education. These aspects are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards use, behavioral intention, and actual use.

The proposed strategy has been implemented in practice to identify its suitability for successful CT development within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education. The strategy is accompanied by teaching materials for computational making activities with Arduino. The proposed strategy contributes to Engineering education as an essential part of STEAM and usually not included in the basic and secondary school curriculum as a separate subject. Pre- and postsurvey were conducted with basic school students to identify the effect of the strategy implementation on the development of CT abilities. The findings of this study showed a statistically significant increase in CT literacy in 14 abilities from seven dimensions: computing artifact, decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, communication and collaboration, computing and society, and evaluation.

These programs enabled teachers to provide interactive ways to enhance students' active engagement and participation with prerecorded video learning materials. However, little research has been done to investigate students' intentions to use such video learning. In this study, a hypothesized model incorporated perceived enjoyment and perceived attractiveness into a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explore the factors that influence elementary school students' intentions to use interactive video learning supported by EDpuzzle. Data collected from 151 sixth-grade pupils at two elementary schools in North Taiwan via a questionnaire were tested against a hypothesized model by using structural equation modeling. Overall, this model predicted a 68.2% variance in behavioral intentions, and 76.4% of the students would have positive attitudes toward using EDpuzzle. The results indicated that perceived attractiveness and perceived enjoyment were determinants that should be considered in explaining elementary school students' behavioral intentions of using EDpuzzle.

It has become to our attention that there is a need to inculcate complex problem-solving skills among youth to equipped them to face the challenges in the era of digital technology. To fulfill the needs, computational thinking was introduced in school curriculum in Malaysia in 2017. It is still rather new, and this creates opportunity to understand how computational thinking can best be integrated in teaching and learning. In this study, we developed a module for a science topic, Matter and examine its impact on computational thinking skills on 65 students at secondary level. The computational thinking skills integrated in this study were abstraction, decomposition, algorithm, generalization, and evaluation. A quasi-experimental method was employed, and the ANCOVA result showed that there was no significant difference between control and treatment group on computational thinking skills. However, the score means for each of the computational thinking skills for both groups, showed that three skills in the treatment group were higher than the control group. The three computational thinking skills were decomposition, evaluation, and algorithm. This study suggested that CT involved mental process and proper planning is crucial to integrate computational thinking skills as teaching and learning is very contextual in nature.;"[Lapawi, Noraini; Husnin, Hazrati] Natl Univ Malaysia, Ctr Teaching & Learning Innovat, Bangi, Malaysia";Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Lapawi, N (corresponding author), Natl Univ Malaysia, Ctr Teaching & Learning Innovat, Bangi, Malaysia.;;"Husnin, Hazrati/AAL-9665-2021; Husnin, Hazrati/JGD-4987-2023";"Husnin, Hazrati/0000-0002-6165-2411; Lapawi, Noraini/0009-0005-3113-7127";[GG-2019-014];;The authors extend their appreciation to the Dana Penyelidikan FPEND at National University of Malaysia, GG-2019-014 for funding this study.;;30;0;0;3;18;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

Information Structure for Generating Descriptive Algorithmic Schemes for Image Recognition;PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"image analysis; descriptive image analysis; mathematical theory of image analysis; automated information extraction from images; image recognition; descriptive algorithmic schemes; models of image analysis procedures; image representations; image models; image recognition algorithms; mathematical structures; information structures; formal systems";;"This article is the fourth in a series of publications devoted to the state of the art and prospects for developing Descriptive Image Analysis, one of the leading and intensively developing fields of modern mathematical image analysis theory. The fundamental problem discussed in the article is to automate information extraction from images necessary for making intelligent decisions. This study is devoted to regularizing the generation of descriptive algorithmic image analysis and recognition schemes. The main result is the definition of a new mathematical structure with the following functional capabilities: 1) solution of an image recognition problem in a given formulation, with given initial data and a scenario that determines the sequence of application of information processing procedures and their iterative loops; 2) construction of descriptive algorithmic schemes for solving a problem with given initial data in the absence of a given scenario; in the case of a successful solution, the fixation of the sequence of procedures and information processing loops that yielded its solution governs the corresponding descriptive algorithmic schemes and scenarios that can be further used to solve the corresponding class of image recognition problems; 3) comparative analysis and optimization of methods for solving image recognition problems via their realization as descriptive algorithmic schemes and scenarios allowed by the structure. The introduced structure is a tool for representing and implementing information processing while solving an image recognition problem for arbitrary formulations, scenarios, models, and solution methods; it can also emulate any descriptive algorithmic scheme and combinations thereof, which are used and generated when solving an image recognition problem. The introduced structure is interpreted as a fundamental model for generating and emulating image recognition procedures. A type characteristic of the introduced information structure for generating descriptive algorithmic schemes is as follows: 1) the set of structure elements consists of two subsets: a) a subset of functional blocks that perform mathematical operations of information processing necessary to implement the used of processing, analysis, and image recognition methods; b) a subset of control blocks for information processing procedures, which verify the logical conditions for branching of processing procedures, whether the rules for stopping information processing are met, etc.; 2) relations given over the elements of the set of the structure, mainly, the partial ordering relations that determine the sequence of execution and methods for combining the functional and control blocks of the structure; 3) these relations, by definition, must satisfy the axioms of the Descriptive Approach to Image Analysis and Understanding. The paper presents the basic definitions associated with the introduction of a new information structure and describes the information processing procedures implemented therein, as well as the main blocks and loops. Block diagrams of the information structure and iteration loops are given. The fundamental importance of the results of the described studies for developing the mathematical theory of image analysis and their scientific novelty are related to formulation of problems and development of methods for modeling the processes for automating image analysis when the input data are poorly formalized representations of images, including spatial data-images and their fragments, image models, incompletely formalized representations, and subsets of combinations thereof. Introduction of a new information structure as a standard structure for a) representation of algorithms for analysis and recognition of 2-dimensional information and representation of procedures for constructing dual representations of images as descriptive algorithmic schemes; b) generation of descriptive algorithmic schemes indicated in (a) will make it possible to generalize and substantiate the known heuristic recognition algorithms, to comparatively analysis them, and to assess their mathematical properties and applied usefulness. The problem of automating the construction and analysis of descriptive algorithmic image recognition schemes is formulated for the first time.";"[Gurevich, I. B.; Yashina, V.

J;Kirsch, CJ;;;;Kirsch, Corinna J.;;;A Three-Person Teaching Machine Designed for Crisis: The Geromat III in Berlin and Ulm;IEEE ANNALS OF THE HISTORY OF COMPUTING;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"This is the first paper to discuss the Geromat III teaching machine developed at the Berlin Institute for Cybernetics in relationship to the Geromat III prototypes developed at Ulm School of Design in the 1960s. The Geromat III was an electro-mechanical teaching machine that could train up to three students at three separate multimedia consoles. The system required all learners to answer correctly in order to progress through the instructional program; if not, the students were required to speak to each other in order to reach agreement. The paper analyzes archival material and first-hand accounts with the Geromat III, as well as the social context of federal funding for research into computing and education in West Germany of the 1960s, in order to understand how this teaching machine, an early form of computer-aided instruction (CAI), came to be. The Geromat III, though utilized on a small scale, found an audience of enthusiastic supporters on the other side of the country, with artist-designers at the Ulm School of Design who created prototypes for consoles to be used with the system. While hands-on knowledge about the system was unavailable to the console designers, an ideological affinity between the Ulm School of Design and the Berlin Institute for Cybernetics bridged any technical gaps in knowledge; the resulting design prototypes, one for mass-production and one for DIY (do-it-yourself) construction, point to speculative futures for the system.";[Kirsch, Corinna J.] SUNY Stony Brook, Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA;"State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook";Kirsch, CJ (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Hist, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.;corinna.kirsch@stonybrook.edu;;Kirsch, Corinna/0000-0002-9856-1951;Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD);Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD));The authors would like to thank the archives of the Ulm School of Design Archive and Paderborn University.

The historical teaching case study is indispensable in improving our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of contemporary digital healthcare promotion programs. This historical teaching case presents information about e-health, the e-commerce unit of a large multinational healthcare insurance company. The teaching case shows how despite e-health's ability to persuade a large registered base of users to trial its healthcare promotion programs, over 90% of these registrants discontinued use after a short trial period of using the technology. This historical teaching case focuses on the social challenges involved in persuading users to adopt and continue using e-health's major healthcare promotion innovation: an online nutrition center. Despite extensive promotions and the use of incentives, less than 10% of the user base adopted and continued to use this healthcare promotion innovation. The case reports on the discontinuance among digital healthcare promotion users despite the intensive efforts to retain them. Students and practitioners will gain insight into the key social challenges involved in achieving a critical mass of users for digital healthcare promotion innovations. The teaching case requires important decisions to be made by students and practitioners about present digital healthcare promotion programs by drawing on inferences from past digital healthcare promotion programs.

It is a technique originated in 2000 BC where simple methods were used in earlier times to keep the information in a way that is not understandable by everyone. Only the intended receiver knows how to decode the information. Later, as technology advances, many sophisticated techniques were used to protect the message so that no intrusion can invade the information. Many mathematically complex algorithms like AES, RSA are used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Due to the advancements in the computer science field, recently, cryptography is used in the development of cryptographic currencies of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology, a distributed ledger technology identified to be the foundation of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, implements a high-level cryptographic technique like public-key cryptography, Hash Functions, Merkle Trees, Digital signatures like Elliptic curve digital signatures, etc. These advanced cryptographic techniques are used to provide security to blockchain data and for the secure transmission of information, thereby making Blockchain more popular and demandable. Blockchain applies cryptography in various phases, and some of the techniques used in Blockchain are advanced in cryptographic sciences. This paper intends to provide a brief introduction to cryptography and Blockchain Technology and discusses how both technologies can be integrated to provide the best of the security to the data. This paper reviews the various cryptographic attacks in Blockchain and the various security services offered in Blockchain.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study combining design-based research (DBR) and a case study was used with video observation as a data collection method. ABR is demonstrated by an empirical analysis of learning activities with (c) Minecraft (hereafter MC) and (c) Second Life(TM)(hereafter SL) used in two teacher education programs. Findings Teachers and students could use the technology with some initial training. Experience in gameplay, collaboration and problem solving eased the transitioning into curricular activities. The teachers integrated domain knowledge by giving students tasks that involved the creation of domain-specific artifacts and role-play scenarios. In total, two dilemmas of educational gap closing were found and discussed: learning domain knowledge vs learning technology and breakdown in action vs breakdown in understanding. Research limitations/implications Automated feedback (critiquing) adapted to students' individual needs while building and role-playing in MC or SL to off-load some of the teachers' work in scaffolding design activities in the classroom is a direction for further work.

SR is a technique that enhances minute details of the image by increasing spatial resolution of imaging systems. SR overcomes the problems of conventional resolution enhancement techniques such as introduction of noise, spectral distortion, and lack of clarity in the details of the image. In this paper, a survey has been conducted since the inception of SR algorithm till the latest state-of-the-art SR techniques to elucidate the importance of the SR algorithms that lead to paradigm shifts in the last two decades revolutionizing toward visually pleasing high-resolution image. Inspired from the natural images, the algorithms addressing the SR problems such as ill-posed, prior and regularization problem, inverse problem, multi-frame problem and illumination and shadow problem in remote sensing applications are analyzed. For an intuitive understanding of the paradigm shifts, publicly available images are tested with representative paradigm shift SR algorithms. The result of this paradigm shift analysis is done both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of blurs in the image, pattern clarity, edge strength, and super-resolving capability. The convergence of the natural image to the remote sensed image is critically analyzed. The challenges with possible solutions for super-resolving the remote sensed image are recommended. On experimentation, it is found that deep learning-based SR algorithms produces visually pleasing images retaining sharp edges, enhanced spatial data, and clarity in feature representation while zooming at a certain level beyond interest.;"[Rohith, G.; Kumar, Lakshmi Sutha] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Pondicherry, India";"National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Puducherry";Rohith, G (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Pondicherry, India.;rohith.giridharan@gmail.com;"Kumar, Lakshmi Sutha/P-9990-2019; Giridharan, Rohith/ABB-4427-2020";", ROHITH G/0000-0001-6120-4056; Kumar, Lakshmi Sutha/0000-0002-9069-3132";;;;;148;16;16;1;23;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0178-2789;1432-2315;;VISUAL COMPUT;Visual Comput.;JUL;2021;37;7;;;;;1965;2008;;10.1007/s00371-020-01957-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00371-020-01957-8;;SEP 2020;44;Computer Science, Software Engineering;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;SZ5DG;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000565484100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An interdisciplinary team at The University of Alberta ----developed a formative model of assessment centered on students and instructor interaction with course content. Design/methodology/approach The paper starts by laying the theoretical groundwork on which this novel GA assessment tool is based, that is, competency-based education, assessment theory and GA assessment. It follows with a description of the online assessment tool for GAs that was developed in the course of this project. Findings The online assessment tool for GAs targets three types of stakeholders: (1) students, who self-assess in terms of GAs, (2) instructors, who use the tool to define the extent to which each GA should be inculcated in their course and (3) administrators, who receive aggregate reports based on the data gathered by the system for high-level analysis and decision-making. Collected data by students and professors advance formative assessment of these transversal skills and assist administration in ensuring the GAs are addressed in academic programs. Graduate attributes assessment program (GAAP) is also a space for students to build a personal portfolio that would be beneficial to highlight their skills for potential employers. Research limitations/implications This research has strong implications for the universities, since it can help institutions, academics and students achieve better results in their practices. This is done by demonstrating strong links between theory and practice. Although this tool has only been used within the university setting by students, instructors and administrators (for self-, course and teaching and program improvement), it could increase its social and practical impact by involving potential employers and increase our understanding of student employability. Moreover, because the tool collects data on a continuous basis, it lends itself to many possible applications in educational data mining, Practical implications The GAAP can be used and adapted to various educational contexts. The plugin can be added to any Learning Management System (LMS), and students can have access to their data and results throughout their education. Social implications The GAAP allows institutions to provide a longitudinal formative assessment of students' graduate attributes acquisition. It provides solid and valid evidence of students' progress in a way that would advance society and citizenship. Originality/value To date, the GAAP is the first online interactive platform that has been developed to longitudinally assess the acquisition of GAs during a complete academic cycle/cohort. It provides a unique space where students and instructors interact with assessment scales and with concrete data for a complete university experience profile.;"[ElAtia, Samira; Zaiane, Osmar; Bakhshinategh, Behdad] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Ipperciel, Donald; Thibaudeau, Patrick] York Univ, York, N Yorkshire, England";"University of Alberta; University of York - UK";"ElAtia, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.;Ipperciel, D (corresponding author), York Univ, York, N Yorkshire, England.";"selatia@ualberta.ca; dipper@yorku.ca; zaiane@ualberta.ca; bakhshin@ualberta.ca; thibaud@glendon.yorku.ca";Zaiane, Osmar R/KIA-3435-2024;Zaiane, Osmar R/0000-0002-0060-5988;Office of the Provost, at the University of Alberta, through a Teaching and Learning Enhancement Funds [RES0025918];Office of the Provost, at the University of Alberta, through a Teaching and Learning Enhancement Funds;The research project on the Assessment of the Graduate Attribute was funded by the Office of the Provost, at the University of Alberta, through a Teaching and Learning Enhancement Funds, Project # RES0025918.

However, in a situation where there are few label examples or the environment is not ideal, such as lighting conditions, orientations, and so on, performance is disappointing. Various methods, such as data augmentation and image registration, have been used in an effort to improve accuracy; nonetheless, performance remains far from human efficiency. Advancement in cognitive science has provided us with valuable insight into how humans achieve high accuracy in identifying and discriminating between different faces and objects. These researches help us understand how the brain uses the features in the face to form a holistic representation and subsequently uses it to discriminate between faces. Our objective and contribution in this paper is to introduce a computational model that leverages these techniques, being used by our brain, to improve robustness and recognition accuracy. The hypothesis is that the biological model, our brain, achieves such high efficiency in face recognition because it is using a two-step process. We therefore postulate that, in the case of a handwritten digit, it will be easier for a learning model to learn invariant features and to generate a holistic representation than to perform classification. The model uses a variational autoencoder to generate holistic representation of handwritten digits and a Neural Network(NN) to classify them. The results obtained in this research show the effectiveness of decomposing the recognition tasks into two specialize sub-tasks, a generator, and a classifier.";"[Joseph, Michael; Elleithy, Khaled] Univ Bridgeport, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Bridgeport, CT 06604 USA";University of Bridgeport;Elleithy, K (corresponding author), Univ Bridgeport, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Bridgeport, CT 06604 USA.;"micjosep@my.bridgeport.edu; elleithy@bridgeport.edu";;Elleithy, Khaled/0000-0001-9239-5035;University of Bridgeport, CT, USA;University of Bridgeport, CT, USA;The authors acknowledge the University of Bridgeport for providing the necessary resources to carry this research conducted under the supervision of Khaled Elleithy.

The world is dynamically changing and intensively interconnected carrying new challenges and opportunities to the new generation of engineers working in a world where innovation will continue to evolve very quickly. This paper addresses the need to train engineering students to be entrepreneurial engineers considering the global challenges and the role that higher education institutions should play in developing an entrepreneurial mindset among engineering students. The paper presents and discusses the results of a survey carried out in a Portuguese engineering school with the goal of investigate students' entrepreneurial mindsets. The main objective is to understand the extent by which entrepreneurship is addressed in students' engineering programs as well as students' perceptions of their entrepreneurial related skills and the reasons that would lead the students to start or not start a business as well as their perception of the ability to immediately start a business. The results of the study are critically analysed in light of the challenges and opportunities facing future engineers.

In this context, this paper addresses the detection and pose classification of a specific vehicle type: auto-rickshaws which have been heavily neglected by the publicly available vehicle datasets, but remains the most commonly used and cheap form of transportation in south Asian countries. Here, we introduce a dataset for auto-rickshaws which consists of instances of varying shape, orientation, size, scale, colour, viewpoint and many more. Further, we carry out a detailed analysis on the performance of state-of-the-art detection algorithms based on both hand-designed and deep features on the proposed dataset. The introduction of pose classification along with the detection eventually results in better understanding of road scenes involving auto-rickshaws. As a matter of fact, we came up with revisions for the currently employed detection algorithms to achieve a low miss rate on the validation sets. It is evident that the findings of this study are tangible and enormously consequential to the road scene understanding and intelligent transportation of developing countries where auto-rickshaws play a pivotal role in public transportation.;"[Bastian, Blossom Treesa; Charangatt Victor, Jiji] Coll Engn Trivandrum, Trivandrum, Kerala, India";College of Engineering, Trivandrum;Bastian, BT (corresponding author), Coll Engn Trivandrum, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.;"blossombastian@cet.ac.in; jijicv@cet.ac.in";;Bastian, Blossom Treesa/0000-0001-5642-4812;;;;;49;1;1;1;4;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0932-8092;1432-1769;;MACH VISION APPL;Mach.

Thus, their integration into Chemical Engineering studies has gained traction over the years in supporting traditional lectures or as the sole tool for knowledge transmission. However, despite their proven benefits in Higher Education, limitations exist, as the application of the tool may result in deficient learning. In fact, the algorithms and design equations that are used to transform inputs into results are not identifiable by the students, thereby instilling a superficial understanding of the problem. Thus, the objective of this paper is to provide some guidelines through three simple case studies, which may help minimize the so-called black box effect. Two different state-of-the-art computational tools were used in parallel. Aspen One simulations provided the reference point, which was used by the students to verify the process models built by them with Mathcad Prime.

The development of professional digital competence (PDC) is emerging as an essential part of teacher education. Due to the increasing use of ICT and the growing number of online teaching and learning resources, the responsible use of ICT has become one of the key aspects of PDC. For the purpose of this paper, the responsible use of ICT includes privacy issues, cyberbullying and the ability to evaluate digital content. We examine Spanish and Norwegian student teachers' perceived competence in privacy issues and in handling cyberbullying and their ability to evaluate digital content. In a survey conducted in autumn 2017, 681 Spanish and 563 Norwegian first-year student teachers in Spain and Norway answered questions on the responsible use of ICT. The findings show that in both countries the three concepts are recognised as distinct and that there is a positive relationship between student teachers' perceived understanding of the concepts. This implies that these concepts should be taught as separate components of PDC. However, it is challenging to compare student teachers' perceived knowledge of the concepts across two countries and to create an integration model that fit both countries.

Hence, lineworkers require effective and safe training. Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees' final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees' trace data through a visualization tool to pose nonobservable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees' final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.;"[Santamaria-Bonfil, Guillermo] CONACYT, INEEL, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Santamaria-Bonfil, Guillermo; Perez-Ramirez, Miguel; Arroyo-Figueroa, Gustavo] Inst Nacl Elect & Energias Limpias, Reforma 113, Cuernavaca 62490, Morelos, Mexico; [Blanca Ibanez, Maria] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ingn Telemat, Madrid 28911, Spain; [Martinez-Alvarez, Francisco] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Data Sci & Big Data Lab, Seville 41013, Spain";"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Pablo de Olavide";Santamaría-Bonfil, G (corresponding author), CONACYT, INEEL, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;"guillermo.santamaria@ineel.mx; mbibanez@it.uc3m.es; mperez@ineel.mx; garroyo@ineel.mx; fmaralv@upo.es";"Martínez-Álvarez, Francisco/L-5121-2014; Arroyo-Figueroa, Gustavo/O-4911-2016; Figueroa, Gustavo Arroyo/AAI-8248-2020; Santamaria, Guillermo/F-7587-2013; IBANEZ, MARIA BLANCA/D-2294-2012";"Arroyo-Figueroa, Gustavo/0000-0003-0764-045X; Santamaria, Guillermo/0000-0003-4302-4902; IBANEZ, MARIA BLANCA/0000-0003-2612-4207; Martinez-Alvarez, Francisco/0000-0002-6309-1785";"program Catedras-CONACYT, Mexico; Madrid Regional Government, Spain through the Project e-Madrid-CM [P2018/TCS-4307]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through Project Smartlet [TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]";"program Catedras-CONACYT, Mexico; Madrid Regional Government, Spain through the Project e-Madrid-CM; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through Project Smartlet";"First author thanks the program Catedras-CONACYT, Mexico for funding his research.

To minimize this effort, we propose CLIK, a cloud-based Linux kernel practice environment supporting automatic judgment. It provides students with an individual and easy-to-use kernel practice environment and instructors with a fast and easy evaluation of students' work with live feedback. Our experiences with two assignments from a real-world OS course carried out on CLIK show that CLIK can successfully provide Linux kernel environments for 40 students and help instructors greatly by validating their kernels within one minute using parallel and automated judgments.

Especially for final-year undergraduate students, job prospects are an important concern. In this study, the graduation project choices of the final-year undergraduate students in the department of computer engineering were investigated in light of their impact on both the industry and academia. A total of 1,693 course grades of 94 final-year undergraduate students were retrieved from the Student Information System. These course grades were utilized as the features of the employed machine learning algorithms alongside the features that were deduced from them. In addition, the popularities of the graduation project topics on both GitHub and IEEE were investigated to reveal their impact on the industry and academia. To this end, we proposed an experimental study, using 14 machine learning techniques, that predicts the topics of the graduation projects that the final-year undergraduate students chose. According to the experimental results, the accuracy of the proposed model was calculated to be as high as 100 % when it was utilized with the Bayes Net, Kleene Star, or J48 algorithm. This experimental result confirms the efficiency of the proposed model.

This is due to the introduction of large medical text/image datasets. Generating radiology coherent paragraphs that do more than traditional medical image annotation, or single sentence-based description, has been the subject of recent academic attention. This presents a more practical and challenging application and moves towards bridging visual medical features and radiologist text. So far, the most common approach has been to utilize publicly available datasets and develop DL models that integrate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image analysis alongside recurrent neural networks (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG). This is an area of research that we anticipate will grow in the near future. We focus our investigation on the following critical challenges: understanding radiology text/image structures and datasets, applying DL algorithms (mainly CNN and RNN), generating radiology text, and improving existing DL based models and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we include a critical discussion and future research recommendations.

However, the presence of severe metal artifacts in CBCT images hinders the accurate segmentation of each individual tooth. In this study, we propose a neural network for pixel-wise labeling to exploit an instance segmentation framework that is robust to metal artifacts. Our method comprises of three steps: 1) image cropping and realignment by pose regressions, 2) metal-robust individual tooth detection, and 3) segmentation. We first extract the alignment information of the patient by pose regression neural networks to attain a volume-of-interest (VOI) region and realign the input image, which reduces the interoverlapping area between tooth bounding boxes. Then, individual tooth regions are localized within a VOI realigned image using a convolutional detector. We improved the accuracy of the detector by employing nonmaximum suppression and multiclass classification metrics in the region proposal network. Finally, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform individual tooth segmentation by converting the pixel-wise labeling task to a distance regression task. Metal-intensive image augmentation is also employed for a robust segmentation of metal artifacts. The result shows that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially for teeth with metal artifacts. Our method demonstrated 5.68% and 30.30% better accuracy in the F1 score and aggregated Jaccard index, respectively, when compared to the best performing state-of-the-art algorithms. The major implication of the proposed method is two-fold: 1) an introduction of pose-aware VOI realignment followed by a robust tooth detection and 2) a metal-robust CNN framework for accurate tooth segmentation.;"[Chung, Minyoung; Lee, Minkyung; Hong, Jioh; Park, Sanguk; Lee, Jusang; Lee, Jingyu; Shin, Yeong-Gil] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Yang, Il-Hyung] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Orthodont, Sch Dent, 101 Daehak Ro, Seoul 03080, South Korea; [Lee, Jeongjin] Soongsil Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 369 Sangdo Ro, Seoul 06978, South Korea";"Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Soongsil University";Lee, J (corresponding author), Soongsil Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, 369 Sangdo Ro, Seoul 06978, South Korea.;"chungmy@cglab.snu.ac.kr; mklee317@cglab.snu.ac.kr; hongzio@cglab.snu.ac.kr; psu9808@cglab.snu.ac.kr; jscsmk@cglab.snu.ac.kr; leejingyu@cglab.snu.ac.kr; drortho@snu.ac.kr; leejeongjin@ssu.ac.kr; yshin@snu.ac.kr";"Lee, Jingyu/AAV-8920-2020; Chung, Minyoung/U-4310-2019";"Lee, Jingyu/0000-0001-9728-7631; Chung, Minyoung/0000-0001-7503-3307; Park, Sanguk/0009-0005-0538-5522";"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) - Korea government(MSIT) [2017-0-01815]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning [2017R1A2B3011475, 2017R1D1A1B03034484]";"Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) - Korea government(MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)";This work was partly supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.2017-0-01815, Development of AR-based Surgery Toolkit and Applications).

So, the teaching techniques have to be modified and equipped with the latest technological tools and practices. Augmented reality (AR) is emerging as a new technology in the field of engineering education. With the help of computer-generated 3D data, animation, visual effects, and immersion, this technology has become more prevalent in the education domain to make complex concepts easier to understand. In this paper, an augmented reality-based framework designed to teach embedded systems to engineering students. The proposed framework utilizes a tangible user interface comprising of AR markers, a USB camera, a display device, and the processing unit to give AR learning experience to the students. The system so developed tested for its usability with the faculty members of engineering education. Twenty faculty members, as participants, share their system usability experience and feedback using google form. The overall system usability score is 79.5%, which makes it suitable for further deployment on students for exploratory work.;"[Kumar, Amit; Mantri, Archana; Dutta, Rubina] Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Rajpura 140401, Punjab, India";Chitkara University, Punjab;Kumar, A (corresponding author), Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Rajpura 140401, Punjab, India.;amit.pandey@chitkara.edu.in;"University, Chitkara/AAZ-3040-2021; dutta, Rubina/AGY-9379-2022; kumar, Amit/AAN-2174-2020";"University, Chitkara/0000-0003-3776-7136; dutta, Rubina/0000-0001-9686-8936; kumar, Amit/0000-0002-0642-5419";;;;;30;18;20;1;21;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

J;"Liu, DW; Zeinaly, S";;;;"Liu, Dawei; Zeinaly, Sajjad";;;A new model for investigating the role of IT-based innovation in the pharmaceutical knowledge-sharing attitude A study of marketing biotechnology firms;KYBERNETES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Marketing; Innovation; Creativity; Knowledge sharing; Learning organization; Biotechnology; Marketing biotechnology";"BEHAVIORAL INTENTION FORMATION; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; VALUE CREATION; PERFORMANCE; TRUST; LEADERSHIP; PLS; INDUSTRY; NETWORKS";Purpose The creation of partnerships among companies, governments and universities can improve innovation and the technological development of institutions. As innovation is a multidimensional concept, more nuanced research is needed to identify, which dimensions of innovation firms should focus on them. This paper aims to investigate the influence of attitude to knowledge sharing (KS) factors, learning organization and creativity on the innovation in marketing biotechnology firms. So, the purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of learning organization, attitude to KS, creativity, information technology (IT) acceptance, KS culture and trust on the innovation by presenting a new framework and a model. Design/methodology/approach The structural equation modeling technique is used to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement of the provided model. Data were collected by questionnaires. A case study was carried out in 100 marketing biotechnology firms in the Tehran of Iran. In this paper, smart partial least squares 2.0 was used to evaluate the measurement. Findings The result showed that all hypotheses of this research are proved. Also, the results have shown that the attitude to KS, learning organization and creativity affect the innovation in marketing biotechnology firms. As an overall result, the managers should create an enhanced knowledge bank to increase and encourage the KS among employees, thus creating and enhancing innovation in organizations. Also, the results have shown that marketing shortages were mostly connected to access to human resources with related management and marketing experiences and were mainly felt by firms introducing discontinuous novelties. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this paper is that the sample was retrieved from 384 employees in 100 marketing biotechnology institutions. The larger number of samples can yield better results. Next, even though the respondents' profiles indicated a high probability of them being cognizant of their organization's efforts in inter-firm KS, learning, creativity and innovation with three or four respondent from each organization answering all questions for such complicated issues always poses the risk of measurement bias and inaccuracy. An ideal situation for future studies would be to pool and compare multiple respondents from the same organization to obtain a more comprehensive firm-level measurement. In addition, this study only surveyed and sampled biotech marketing companies in Iran. Therefore, the model should be examined using samples from other countries because the varieties of culture could have an impact on employee apprehensions. So, future researchers can test the measurement instrument in different countries and/or conduct large multi-national comparisons. Practical implications Successful marketing strategies depend very much on an organization's ability to implement them. This paper provides an excellent study about the future of pharmaceutical KS and shows that innovation paths are linked with local and temporary occasions. Also, the results of this study provide valuable information in formulating marketing biotechnology programs. It is essential to study both economics and innovation for students and academics. The results also suggested that policies to increase economic research will also increase innovation. They could contain the consolidation of the legal framework and institutional resources for public organizations to protect intellectual properties. In general, for successful implementation of strategies an organization has to integrate KS, processes and IT. Social implications The paper identifies the most critical factors in the innovation process of enterprizes in marketing biotechnology institutions. The implications derived from this study can shed new light upon policy-making both at the level of governance and in the management practice in Iran's marketing biotechnology industry. Also, the paper increases understanding of the innovation process in Iran marketing biotechnology companies. This study contributes to innovating management research by offering a set of legal and dependable operational measures. These measures can help academics in theory analysis. Originality/value This is the first attempt examining the role of the learning organization, creativity and attitude to KS as a key contingency factor in innovation in Iran marketing biotechnology firms, an issue whose understanding is still developing in the literature. The paper adds to the body of knowledge by allowing better understanding the attitude toward KS and the influence of KS, learning and creativity on innovation. Previous studies did not investigate the KS in marketing biotechnology firms deeply, but, the present paper permits a more complete view on this topic. The guidelines are provided for the top directors to promote KS and innovation according to the research results. From a managerial point of view some critical elements, which are important for the success of KS and application of these elements for progressing institutional guidelines to develop KS, are considered. Theoretical foundations can be extracted from this study, and these foundations can be implemented to investigate connection in KS elements such as feasibilities processes and institution initiative abilities. So, the results could be suitable to managers when arranging an organization and shaping its culture to improve knowledge management.;"[Liu, Dawei] East China Normal Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zeinaly, Sajjad] Islamic Azad Univ Ajabshir, Dept Management, Ajabshir Branch, Esfahan, Iran";"East China Normal University; Islamic Azad University";Liu, DW (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;"sh.zhi98@gmail.com; salmas.mh@umsu.ac.ir";;;;;;;123;6;6;2;34;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;Leeds;floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0368-492X;1758-7883;;KYBERNETES;Kybernetes;MAY 3;2021;50;5;;;;;1095;1124;;10.1108/K-07-2019-0505;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-07-2019-0505;;APR 2020;30;Computer Science, Cybernetics;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";Computer Science;WB2FM;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000529384800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Efficient understanding of such problems in undergraduate and graduate courses should be supported by rich visualization tools. The Smith chart is a convenient tool for transmission line calculations especially for wave propagation and maximum power theory that discusses impedance matching problems. In this context, we can say that Java is a widely used open source educational tool having strong computational environment for research and development aims. In this study, an open source transmission line impedance matching educational framework (TLIME) has been designed to teach efficiently wave propagation and maximum power theory that discusses the impedance matching problems. The success of developed educational framework has been measured by a questionnaire held in courses in the third and fourth years of the electrical and electronics engineering undergraduate program at Sakarya University of Applied Sciences, Turkey. The visual preparation of the problem solutions with rich graphical user interface and simulations of the mathematical representations has been evaluated to contribute to a better understanding of the wave propagation and impedance matching transmission line subjects. The functionality and simplicity of the developed framework scored by over 82% among course enrolled students. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

New domain adaptation and transfer learning methods can potentially address this issue. Objective: We examine neural unsupervised domain adaptation methods, introducing a novel combination of domain adaptation with transformer-based transfer learning methods to improve negation detection. We also want to better understand the interaction between the widely used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) system and domain adaptation methods. Materials and Methods: We use 4 clinical text datasets that are annotated with negation status. We evaluate a neural unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm and BERT, a transformer-based model that is pretrained on massive general text datasets. We develop an extension to BERT that uses domain adversarial training, a neural domain adaptation method that adds an objective to the negation task, that the classifier should not be able to distinguish between instances from 2 different domains. Results: The domain adaptation methods we describe show positive results, but, on average, the best performance is obtained by plain BERT (without the extension). We provide evidence that the gains from BERT are likely not additive with the gains from domain adaptation. Discussion: Our results suggest that, at least for the task of clinical negation detection, BERT subsumes domain adaptation, implying that BERT is already learning very general representations of negation phenomena such that fine-tuning even on a specific corpus does not lead to much overfitting. Conclusion: Despite being trained on nonclinical text, the large training sets of models like BERT lead to large gains in performance for the clinical negation detection task.;"[Lin, Chen; Sadeque, Farig; Savova, Guergana; Miller, Timothy A.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Computat Hlth Informat Program, Mail Stop BCH3187300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Lin, Chen; Sadeque, Farig; Savova, Guergana; Miller, Timothy A.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bethard, Steven] Univ Arizona, Sch Informat, Tucson, AZ USA; [Dligach, Dmitriy] Loyola Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Sadeque, Farig; Savova, Guergana; Miller, Timothy A.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Pediat, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"Harvard University; Boston Children's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of Arizona; Loyola University Chicago; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School";Miller, TA (corresponding author), Boston Childrens Hosp, Computat Hlth Informat Program, Mail Stop BCH3187300 Longwood Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;timothy.miller@childrens.harvard.edu;;Bethard, Steven/0000-0001-9560-6491;National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health [R01LM012918, R01LM012973];National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM));Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers R01LM012918 and R01LM012973.

Similarly, understanding the non-linear behaviour of the elements in a structure can also allow for a less conservative structural response to be calculated by better understanding the cracked (i.e., effective) properties of the various RC elements. Calculating the non-linear response of an RC section typically involves using 'black box' analysis packages, wherein the user may not be in complete control nor be aware of all the intricate settings and/or decisions behind the scenes. This paper introduces a user-friendly and transparent analysis program for predicting the back-bone force displacement behavior of slender (i.e., flexure controlled) RC walls, building cores or columns. The program has been validated and benchmarked theoretically against both commonly available and widely used analysis packages and experimentally against a database of 16 large-scale RC wall test specimens. The program, which is called WHAM, is written using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to promote transparency and allow users to further develop or modify to suit individual requirements. The program is available free-of-charge and is intended to be used as an educational tool for structural designers, researchers or students.;"[Menegon, Scott J.; Wilson, John L.; Gad, Emad F.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Lam, Nelson T.

Recently, the task of predicting students' performance from their campus behaviors has aroused the researchers' attention. However, existing studies mainly focus on extracting statistical features manually from the pre-stored data, resulting in hysteresis in predicting students' achievement and finding out their problems. Furthermore, due to the limited representation capability of these manually extracted features, they can only understand the students' behaviors shallowly. To make the prediction process timely and automatically, we treat the performance prediction task as a short-term sequence prediction problem, and propose a two-stage classification framework, i.e., Sequence-based Performance Classifier (SPC), which consists of a sequence encoder and a classic data mining classifier. More specifically, to deeply discover the sequential features from students' campus behaviors, we first introduce an attention-based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN) to encode their recent behaviors by giving a higher weight to the ones that are related to the students' last action. Then, to conduct student performance prediction, we further involve these learned features to the classic Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and finally achieve our SPC model. We conduct extensive experiments in the real-world student card dataset.

Then his contribution to the proper understanding of the duality principle in electric network theory is presented. The last two sections are strongly related to the concept of genericity, leading to some results in the qualitatively reliable synthesis of linear multiports and to some considerations on how to store the data of linear multiports.

This topic is relatively complex and can be challenging for students. Thus, programming language Octave has been introduced in the course curriculum of Telecommunication Systems as one of the powerful tools that aid in student understanding of the spread-spectrum principles. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the teaching method of spread-spectrum technique and its application in telecommunications, with the aim to make this topic understandable to students. The participants of the experiment were fifth-semester electrical engineering students (N = 86) at a college of applied sciences. To test the previous knowledge of students needed to understand the theory of spread spectrum, a pretest was carried out which refers to general terms from the fundamentals of telecommunications. With the aim to deeper apprehend the necessary theory from this area, the students had to solve examples from engineering practice using open source software Octave, as well as computational tasks, regarding both methods in spread-spectrum technology. It has been shown that thanks to the visualization of appropriate material, students of the experimental group understood in more detail the method of generating spread-spectrum signals and the influence of individual parameters on partial signals, in relation to students who did not have the opportunity to use Octave. The results of the research lead us to conclude that software like Octave should be included in courses like Telecommunication Systems as a supplement to the traditional teaching and learning methods.;"[Cisar, Petar] Univ Criminal Invest & Police Studies, Dept Informat, Belgrade, Serbia; [Odry, Peter] Coll Dunaujvaros, Dept Informat, Dunaujvaros, Hungary; [Odry, Peter; Maravic Cisar, Sanja; Stankov, Gordana] Subotica Tech, Coll Appl Sci, Marka Oreskovica 16, Subotica 24000, Serbia";;Maravic Cisar, S (corresponding author), Subotica Tech, Coll Appl Sci, Marka Oreskovica 16, Subotica 24000, Serbia.;sanjam@vts.su.ac;Maravić Čisar, Sanja/HKN-4385-2023;Maravic Cisar, Sanja/0000-0001-8131-9141;;;;;18;3;3;0;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

The next generation of engineers has to be trained to appreciate economic, environmental, and societal impacts of its decisions, with an international perspective and at a local and global scale. The aim of this paper is to contribute to identifying the strengths and limits of current sustainability education practices to will be able to improve future decision-makers' and product designers' training. The first step of our research concerns the identification of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values associated with sustainability and ecodesign to highlight what kind of engineers' competencies for sustainability have to be trained. Based on this identification, we examine the French education system from secondary school to university to study sustainability and ecodesign integration in different technological French curricula and practices. The objective is to estimate the effective place of sustainable development and ecodesign in the technological training courses. We analyze programs and complete our approach by observing teachers in their classrooms or by conducting interviews. Even if concepts, knowledge and skills related to ecodesign appear in many different programs, our study emphasizes that there is not a continuum between pre-secondary school, high school, and university. As a consequence, teachers have difficulties to understand the aims and the coherence of the program, and students are not really comfortable with the issues of sustainability and ecodesign. We propose to improve programs and practices by developing multidisciplinary curricula covering most of the sustainable issues and integrating best practices of international universities.;"[Perpignan, Catherine; Baouch, Yacine; Eynard, Benoit] Univ Technol Compiegne, Roberval Lab, UMR CNRS 6253, Ctr Pierre Guillaumat, BP 60319,Rue Docteur Schweitzer, F-60203 Compiegne, France; [Robin, Vincent] Univ Bordeaux, IMS Lab, UMR CNRS 5218, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France";"Universite de Technologie de Compiegne; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)";Robin, V (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, IMS Lab, UMR CNRS 5218, 351 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.;vincent.robin@u-bordeaux.fr;"Eynard, Benoit/ABB-8857-2021; ROBIN, Vincent/C-1674-2015";"Eynard, Benoit/0000-0002-5393-4363; ROBIN, Vincent/0000-0002-0351-9444";;;;;47;0;0;2;15;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0890-0604;1469-1760;;AI EDAM;AI EDAM-Artif.

This study contributes to understandings about how to design a summer blogging program that both engages students and supports ongoing literacy learning over summer. Existing small-scale studies provide reason to expect that continuation of a school blogging approach is likely to be an effective component to ameliorating the effect of summer for economically disadvantaged students. Here we build on those attempts by investigating how to design such a program to maximise participation and engagement, and then test the efficacy of that design. Program development was a multi-phased, iterative process consistent with a design-based approach to educational research (Anderson & Shattuck, 2012). Learning design needed to be both appealing, to promote sign up, and engaging, to promote ongoing use. Results suggest that blogging in response to well-designed activities had an impact on the summer learning effect in writing and in reading.;"[Williamson, Rachel; Jesson, Rebecca] Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Te Putahi Whakatairanga Hapori Ako Angitu, Woolf Fisher Res Ctr, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Shepherd, Daisy] Royal Childrens Hosp, Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Flemington Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia";"University of Auckland; Murdoch Children's Research Institute; Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne";Jesson, R (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Educ & Social Work, Te Putahi Whakatairanga Hapori Ako Angitu, Woolf Fisher Res Ctr, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.;"rachel.williamson@auckland.ac.nz; r.jesson@auckland.ac.nz; daisy.shepherd@mcri.edu.au";"Shepherd, Daisy/CAF-2302-2022; Jesson, Rebecca/K-2030-2017";"Shepherd, Daisy/0000-0001-8540-0473; Jesson, Rebecca/0000-0003-4673-9655";"University of Auckland; Woolf Fisher Trust; NEXT Foundation; Wright Family Foundation";"University of Auckland; Woolf Fisher Trust; NEXT Foundation; Wright Family Foundation";We would like to acknowledge and thank the MSA Charitable Trust who provided the salary of the lead researcher over the duration of the project, the University of Auckland, the Woolf Fisher Trust, NEXT Foundation and the Wright Family Foundation for providing the operational funding to cover the expenses related to the development and implementation of the program.;;41;5;6;0;21;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

The announcement received little media coverage even though it is an interesting development in the battle against fake news. This paper aims to review the current literature on different approaches in the battle against the spread of fake news, including the use of computer algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and introduction of ID checks. Design/methodology/approach Critical to the evaluation is consideration into ID checks as a means to combat the spread of fake news. To understand the process and how it works, the team undertook a social experiment combined with reflective analysis to better understand the impact of ID check policies when combined with other standards policies of a typical platform. Findings The analysis identifies grave concerns. In a wider context, standardising such policy will leave political activists in countries vulnerable to reprisal from authoritarian regimes. Other victims of the impacts include people who use fake names to protect the identity of adopted children or to protect anonymity from abusive partners. Originality/value The analysis also points to the fact that troll armies could bypass these checks rendering the use of ID checks less effective in the battle to combat fake news.;"[Pourghomi, Pardis; Dordevic, Milan] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Engn & Technol, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Safieddine, Fadi] Univ East London, Sch Architecture Comp & Engn, London, England";"American University of the Middle East; University of East London";Pourghomi, P (corresponding author), Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Engn & Technol, Kuwait, Kuwait.;pardis.pourghomi@aum.edu.kw;"Safieddine, Fadi/AAN-9337-2020; Dordevic, Milan/AAH-2471-2021";"Safieddine, Fadi/0000-0002-6241-6197; Dordevic, Milan/0000-0002-1478-8367";;;;;32;1;1;0;23;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1742-7371;1742-738X;;INT J PERVASIVE COMP;Int.

While numerous studies attempted to develop intelligent classifiers for anticipating student achievement, they overlooked the importance of identifying the key factors that lead to the achieved performance. Such identification is essential to empower program leaders to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their academic programs, and thereby take the necessary corrective interventions to ameliorate student achievements. To this end, our paper contributes, firstly, a hybrid regression model that optimizes the prediction accuracy of student academic performance, measured as future grades in different courses, and, secondly, an optimized multi-label classifier that predicts the qualitative values for the influence of various factors associated with the obtained student performance. The prediction of student performance is produced by combining three dynamically weighted techniques, namely collaborative filtering, fuzzy set rules, and Lasso linear regression. However, the multi-label prediction of the influential factors is generated using an optimized self-organizing map. We empirically investigate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our entire approach on seven publicly available and varying datasets. The experimental results show considerable improvements compared to single baseline models (e.g. linear regression, matrix factorization), demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach in pinpointing multiple factors impacting student performance. As future works, this research emphasizes the need to predict the student attainment of learning outcomes.;"[Alshanqiti, Abdullah; Namoun, Abdallah] Islamic Univ Madinah, Fac Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah 42351, Saudi Arabia";Islamic University of Al Madinah;"Alshanqiti, A; Namoun, A (corresponding author), Islamic Univ Madinah, Fac Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah 42351, Saudi Arabia.";"a.m.alshanqiti@gmail.com; a.namoun@iu.edu.sa";"Namoun, Abdallah/AAT-1905-2021; Alshanqiti, Abdullah/AAV-3441-2020";"Namoun, Abdallah/0000-0002-7050-0532; Alshanqiti, Abdullah/0000-0002-6080-5236";Deanship of Scientific Research, Distinguished Project, Islamic University in Madinah [22 -2018 -2019];Deanship of Scientific Research, Distinguished Project, Islamic University in Madinah;This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Distinguished Project, Islamic University in Madinah, under Grant #22 -2018 -2019.;;69;32;33;8;40;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;203827;203844;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3036572;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3036572;;;18;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";OS8QR;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000590423900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An important challenge in this area is identifying the most difficult topics for students in a subject, which is of great use to improve the quality of teaching by devoting more effort to those topics of greater difficulty, assigning them more time, resources and materials. We have approached the problem by means of natural language processing techniques. In particular, we propose a solution based on a deep learning model that automatically extracts the main topics that are covered in educational documents. This model is next applied to the problem of identifying the most difficult topics for students in a subject related to the study of algorithms and data structures in a Computer Science degree. Our results show that our topic identification model presents very high accuracy (around 90 percent) and may be efficiently used in learning analytics applications, such as the identification and understanding of what makes the learning of a subject difficult. An exhaustive analysis of the case study has also revealed that there are indeed topics that are consistently more difficult for most students, and also that the perception of difficulty in students and teachers does not always coincide with the actual difficulty indicated by the data, preventing to pay adequate attention to the most challenging topics.;"[Araujo, Lourdes; Lopez-Ostenero, Fernando; Martinez-Romo, Juan; Plaza, Laura] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Dept Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Madrid 28040, Spain";Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED);Araujo, L (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Educ Distancia UNED, Dept Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Madrid 28040, Spain.;lurdes@lsi.uned.es;"Plaza, Laura/H-9995-2015; Araujo, Lourdes/G-6272-2015";"Plaza, Laura/0000-0001-5144-8014; Lopez-Ostenero, Fernando/0000-0002-7324-1329; Martinez-Romo, Juan/0000-0002-6905-7051; Araujo, Lourdes/0000-0002-7657-4794";Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED) [GID2017-1(2019)];Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED);This work was supported in part by the Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED) under Grant GID2017-1(2019).;;27;2;2;3;19;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;218002;218014;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3042099;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3042099;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";PD6LK;;Green Published, gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000597793700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

School and family tutoring offer personalized help and provide positive feedback on students & x2019; learning. Predicting students & x2019; performance is of much interest which reflects their understanding on the subjects. Particularly it is desired students to manage well in fundamental knowledge in order to build a strong foundation for post-secondary studies and career. In this paper, improved conditional generative adversarial network based deep support vector machine (ICGAN-DSVM) algorithm has been proposed to predict students & x2019; performance under supportive learning via school and family tutoring. Owning to the nature of the students & x2019; academic dataset is generally low sample size. ICGAN-DSVM offers dual benefits for the nature of low sample size in students & x2019; academic dataset in which ICGAN increases the data volume whereas DSVM enhances the prediction accuracy with deep learning architecture. Results with 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed ICGAN-DSVM yields specificity, sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.968, 0.971 and 0.954 respectively. Results also suggest that incorporating both school and family tutoring into the prediction model could further improve the performance compared with only school tutoring and only family tutoring. To show the necessity of ICGAN and DSVM, comparison has been made between ICGAN and traditional conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Also, the proposed kernel design via heuristic based multiple kernel learning (MKL) is compared with typical kernels including linear, radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid. The prediction of student & x2019;s performance with and without GAN is presented which is followed by comparison with DSVM and with traditional SVM.

It can not only help students understand the experimental principles, but also help them memorize the experimental procedures. However, there are still some problems in virtual chemistry experiments. First, in existing research, user intentions are often misunderstood and cannot be accurately understood. Second, the existing research fail to identify the user's wrong actions, which reduce the accuracy of the experiment. Third, the user sense of operation and realism is not strong during the experiment, which reduces the user's experience. Finally, the lack of navigation guidance for experimental operations increases user learning time. In order to solve these problems. This paper proposes a scheme for establishing an intelligent navigational chemical laboratory based on multimodal fusion. First of all, we design a new smart beaker structure with perceptual ability, which can be used to complete most chemical experiments and give users a real sense of experience. Besides, we propose a multimodal fusion understanding algorithm, which reduces the misidentification of the experiment and better understands the real intention of the user. Finally, intelligent navigation and wrong behavior recognition functions are added to the experimental equipment, which improves the efficiency of human-computer interaction. The results show that Compared with the existing virtual laboratory or system, the chemical laboratory scheme proposed in this paper through multimodal fusion understanding algorithm greatly reduces the user's memory load and improves the success rate of the experiment. Moreover, through the combination of virtual and real, the virtual chemistry experiment not only improves the authenticity of the operation, but also stimulates the students' interest in learning, which is well received by users.;"[Dong, Di; Feng, Zhiquan; Yuan, Jie; Meng, Xin; Meng, Junhong; Kong, Dan] Jinan Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China; [Dong, Di; Yuan, Jie; Meng, Xin; Meng, Junhong; Kong, Dan] Shandong Prov Key Lab Network Based Intelligent C, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China";University of Jinan;Feng, ZQ (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China.;ise_fengzq@ujn.edu.cn;"Liu, Gui/JHU-8707-2023; dong, Dong/JFJ-3808-2023; wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; dong, dong/JQV-8909-2023";;"National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2018YFB1004901]; Independent Innovation Team Project of Jinan City [2019GXRC013]";"National Key RAMP;D Program of China; Independent Innovation Team Project of Jinan City";This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFB1004901), and the Independent Innovation Team Project of Jinan City (No. 2019GXRC013).;;36;1;1;2;29;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;173766;173778;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025229;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025229;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";NX7JJ;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000575882400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Individual differences depend on the students' personality traits. Numerous studies have indicated that understanding the role of personality in the learning process can facilitate learning. Hence, personality identification in e-learning is a critical issue in education. In this study, we propose the enhanced extended nearest neighbor (EENN) algorithm to automatically identify two of the Big Five personality traits from students' behavior in online learning: openness to experience and extraversion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation approach on data from 662 senior high school students. The experimental results indicate that the EENN method can automatically recognize personality at an average accuracy of 0.758. The optimized method that combines EENN with particle swarm optimization significantly improves the identification, resulting in an average accuracy of 0.976. The results can benefit students by increasing the accuracy of personalization based on their personality traits, while simultaneously allowing them to be better understood and possibly allowing their instructors to provide more appropriate learning interventions.;"[Lai, Song; Wu, Fati] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Educ Technol, Fac Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Sun, Bo; Xiao, Rong] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China";"Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University";Sun, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;"laisong@mail.bnu.edu.cn; tosunbo@bnu.edu.cn; wft@bnu.edu.cn";;"SUN, BO/0000-0003-1168-1051; Lai, Song/0000-0002-9582-6790";"National Education Science Twelfth Five-Year Plan Key Issues of the Ministry of Education of China [DCA140229, 2019]; Comprehensive Discipline Construction Fund of Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University";"National Education Science Twelfth Five-Year Plan Key Issues of the Ministry of Education of China; Comprehensive Discipline Construction Fund of Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University";This study was supported by the National Education Science Twelfth Five-Year Plan Key Issues of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. DCA140229) and funded by 2019 Comprehensive Discipline Construction Fund of Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University.;;72;18;20;4;54;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

Despite the benefits of diversity, elucidating the conceptual coherence among different theories is urgent to advance our understanding of academic entrepreneurship. Although both embeddedness and ecosystem theory stress the environmental importance of students' start-ups, the RBV and CBV studies have emphasized the different dimensions of the ecosystem components without considering coherence and interactions between them. The goal of this research is to reconcile the RBV and CBV by not only comparing their relative strengths but also elucidating their reciprocal interactions in an analytical framework. Based on a national survey data of 136 universities in South Korea, this research first investigates the positive impact of the RBV variables on the venture creation, such as university technological assets, incubator administration, and venture funds, and the CBV variables, including entrepreneurship education programs and student clubs. Second, by comparing the relative influence, this research shows that the effects of the CBV variables on start-up formation are stronger than that of the RBV variables. Third, the analyses of interaction effect show that the incubator administration strengthens the positive impact of education programs on the start-up formation, while the venture funds substitute the effect of education programs on academic entrepreneurship.;"[Lee, Kyoung-Joo] Gachon Univ, Coll Social Sci, Seongnam 13120, South Korea; [Yun, Yang-Joong] Fukuoka Inst Technol, Coll Socioenvironm Studies, Fukuoka 8110295, Japan";"Gachon University; Fukuoka Institute of Technology";Yun, YJ (corresponding author), Fukuoka Inst Technol, Coll Socioenvironm Studies, Fukuoka 8110295, Japan.;yun@fit.ac.jp;;Lee, Kyoung-Joo/0000-0001-6275-3209;"JSPS KAKENHI [18K01869]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18K01869] Funding Source: KAKEN";"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant 18K01869.;;44;3;6;2;18;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;143274;143284;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014213;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014213;;;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";NB5XS;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000560585400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This is the case for history, geography, the earth sciences, and other subjects. However, so far, little has been done to provide adequate learning tools that can support such an important transformation. This paper proposes the integration of advanced geospatial technology in traditional interactive learning tools as a way to describe experiences that help students understand phenomena and improve their competencies. The system is the result of a usability engineering process aimed at providing users with an effective learning experience, iteratively analysing their expectations and needs with respect to geo-referenced content.

This creates a great impact on their education as well as personal life. In this paper, an analysis has been made to study the impact of yoga on engineering students. To understand the impact. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) approaches have been utilized. An EEG based BCI is used which will give a direct view of whats going on in the students' brains. Methodology: In this work, an experiment has been performed on engineering students and their brain activity is recorded before and after practicing yoga. In the experimental procedure, EEG signals are acquired from 8 electrodes which are associated with the cognitive and memory-related tasks of the brain. During each trial, participants solve the set of mathematical questionnaire. EEG signals are acquired during test trials before and after the yoga session. A bandpass filter is applied to preprocess the EEG signals. A discrete wavelet transform is implemented for feature extraction of the preprocessed signals. Results: Different classification algorithms are applied to classify the EEG signals before and after the yoga session. To measure the classification performance, measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are presented in the paper. The highest accuracy of 95 % is achieved with Probabilistic Neural Network. Classification concluded the variations in signals before and after yoga. Further, in this work analysis of frequency bands, accuracy and score of the subjects before and after the yoga session are also done.;"[Shinde, Hemendra Vijay; Patil, Devashri Manohar; Mahananda, Malkauthekar] Govt Coll Engn, Karad, India; [Edla, Damodar Reddy; Bablani, Annushree] Natl Inst Technol Goa, Ponda, India";"National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Goa";Edla, DR (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Goa, Ponda, India.;dr.reddy@nitgoa.ac.in;;"Bablani, Annushree/0000-0003-3246-1402; Shinde, hemendra/0000-0001-8539-6208";;;;;35;3;3;0;9;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1064-1246;1875-8967;;J INTELL FUZZY SYST;J.

First, we briefly introduce the research background, a novel OO teaching practice with consecutive and iterative assignments consisting of programming and testing assignments. We propose a planned quantitative method for assessing students& x2019; gains in terms of programming performance and testing performance. Based on real data collected from students who engaged in our course, we use trend analysis to observe how students& x2019; performance has improved over the whole semester. By using correlation analysis, we obtain some interesting findings on how students& x2019; programming performance correlates with testing performance, which provides persuasive empirical evidence in integrating software testing practices into an Object-oriented programming curriculum. Then, we conduct an empirical study on how students& x2019; design competencies are represented by their program code quality changes over consecutive assignments by analyzing their submitted source code in the course system and the GitLab repository. Three different kinds of profiles are found in the students& x2019; program quality in the OO design level. The group analysis results reveal several significant differences in their programming performance and testing performance. Moreover, we conduct systematical explanations on how students& x2019; programming skill improvement can be attributed to their object-oriented design competency. By performing principal component analysis on software statistical data, a predictive OO metrics suite for both students& x2019; programming performance and their testing performance is proposed. The results show that these quality factors can serve as useful predictors of students& x2019; learning performance and can provide effective feedback to the instructors in the teaching practices.";"[Sun, Qing; Wu, Ji; Liu, Kaiqi] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China";Beihang University;Wu, J (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;wuji@buaa.edu.cn;;;;;;;36;9;9;2;10;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;37505;37517;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973470;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973470;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";LC7XF;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000525545900002;View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose, this research is devoted to advance an efficient model for identifying prominent features and predicting the green consumption behaviors of college students. The proposed prediction model is based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) with an effective swarm intelligence method, which is called OBLFA_GWO. The optimization core takes advantage of the firefly algorithm (FA) and opposition-based learning (OBL) to mitigate the immature convergence of the grey wolf algorithm (GWO). In the proposed prediction framework, OBLFA_GWO is utilized to identify influential features. Then, the enhanced KNN model is used to identify the importance and interrelationships of features in samples and construct an effective and stable predictive model for decision support. Five other well-known algorithms are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed OBLFA_GWO strategy using 13 benchmark test problems. Also, the non-parametric statistical Wilcoxon sign rank and Friedman tests are conducted to validate the significance of the proposed OBLFA_GWO against other peers. Experimental results indicate that the FA and OBL can significantly boost the core exploratory and exploitative trends of GWO in dealing with the optimization tasks. Also, the OBLFA_GWO-based KNN (OBLFA_GWO-KNN) model is compared with four classical classifiers, such as kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), back-propagation neural network method (BPNN), and random forest (RF) and five advanced feature selection methods in terms of four standard evaluation indexes. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed OBLFA_GWO-KNN can reach to 96.334 % on the real-life dataset collected from nine universities. Also, the proposed binary OBLFA_GWO algorithm has improved the classification performance of KNN compared to the other peers. Hopefully, the established adaptive OBLFA_GWO-KNN model can be considered as a useful tool for predicting students' behavior of green consumption.;"[Tang, Hua] Wenzhou Univ, Sch Business, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yueting; Lin, Aiju; Chen, Huiling] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China; [Heidari, Ali Asghar] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Surveying & Geospatial Engn, Tehran 1417466191, Iran; [Heidari, Ali Asghar] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore 117417, Singapore; [Wang, Mingjing] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Luo, Yungang] Second Hosp Jilin Univ, Dept Stomatol, Changchun 130041, Peoples R China; [Li, Chengye] Wenzhou Med Univ, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China";"Wenzhou University; Wenzhou University; University of Tehran; National University of Singapore; Duy Tan University; Jilin University; Wenzhou Medical University";"Chen, HL (corresponding author), Wenzhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou 325035, Peoples R China.;Luo, YG (corresponding author), Second Hosp Jilin Univ, Dept Stomatol, Changchun 130041, Peoples R China.;Li, CY (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China.";"chenhuiling.jlu@gmail.com; luoygjlu@sina.com; lichengye41@126.com";"Wang, Mingjing/HCH-5581-2022; Heidari, Ali Asghar/M-6255-2018; Chen, Huiling/N-8510-2019";"Heidari, Ali Asghar/0000-0001-6938-9948; Chen, Huiling/0000-0002-7714-9693; Wang, Ming-jing/0009-0006-3399-2853; Xu, Yueting/0000-0001-8125-5942";"Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China [ZG2017019, R20190016]; Graduate Scienti~c Research Foundation of Wenzhou University [3162018024]; Zhejiang University Students Science and Technology Innovation Activity Plan [2019R429043]; Medical and Health Technology Projects of Zhejiang Province, China [2019RC207]; Special Health Project of Department of Finance of Jilin Province of China [3D518S533429, 3D5177703429]; Jilin Provincial Economic Structure Strategic Adjustment and Guidance Special Fund Project [2014Y072]; Provincial Special Health Project of Jilin Province of China [3D516D7034299]";"Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China; Graduate Scienti~c Research Foundation of Wenzhou University; Zhejiang University Students Science and Technology Innovation Activity Plan; Medical and Health Technology Projects of Zhejiang Province, China; Special Health Project of Department of Finance of Jilin Province of China; Jilin Provincial Economic Structure Strategic Adjustment and Guidance Special Fund Project; Provincial Special Health Project of Jilin Province of China";This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China, under Grant ZG2017019 and Grant R20190016, in part by the Graduate Scienti~c Research Foundation of Wenzhou University under Grant 3162018024, in part by the Zhejiang University Students Science and Technology Innovation Activity Plan under Grant 2019R429043, in part by the Medical and Health Technology Projects of Zhejiang Province, China, under Grant 2019RC207, in part by the Special Health Project of Department of Finance of Jilin Province of China under Grant 3D518S533429 and Grant 3D5177703429, in part by the Jilin Provincial Economic Structure Strategic Adjustment and Guidance Special Fund Project under Grant 2014Y072, and in part by the Provincial Special Health Project of Jilin Province of China under Grant 3D516D7034299.;;71;47;48;0;23;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2020;8;;;;;;35546;35562;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973763;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973763;;;17;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";LQ8WM;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000535278900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

With this in mind, the current study seeks to promote in-depth conceptual understanding of science pharmacology content among students from health-care programs nursing, nutrition, and health education by introducing learning with agent-based models. While the literature shows that learning with agent-based models promotes better conceptual understanding than more traditional approaches, to achieve these potential benefits, instructional supports are needed. This study employed an experimental pre- and post-test design comparing two forms of instructional approaches for learning with agent-based models: one group learned with agent based models using the vicarious approach, where pairs observed and collaboratively discussed recordings of others' learning with agent-based models; the other group explored agent-based models in pairs while collaboratively discussing a set of text-based prompts, the guided exploration approach. The results revealed significantly higher pharmacology learning gains following the vicarious instructional approach compared with the guided exploration of agent based models. Thus, findings suggest that learning from observation can be comparable and even superior to the guided exploration approach with regard to the immediate knowledge gains when collaboratively dialoguing with a peer while observing dialogue of others takes place.

The use of digital is largely developed to ensure a good quality of education. Universities therefore use large-scale learning management systems to manage the interaction between learners and teachers. Teachers can provide online training and educational materials for students following their classes and courses, monitor their participation and evaluate their performance. Students can use interactive features such as discussion threads, videoconferences, and discussion forums. These online tools make it possible to create new social networks or connect online social interactions. This will allow us to understand the structure of this complex network and extract useful information. In this article, we report our research on the detection of student learning communities based on learner activity. We found that it is possible to group students in communities through their messages and response structures using standard community detection algorithms. Also, that their behaviours can be strongly correlated with their closest peers who belong to the same community.;"[Salhi, Intissar; El Fazazi, Hanaa; Qbadou, Mohammed; Mansouri, Khalifa] Univ Hassan 2, Lab Signals Distributed Syst & Artificial Intelli, Casablanca, Morocco";Hassan II University of Casablanca;Salhi, I (corresponding author), Univ Hassan 2, Lab Signals Distributed Syst & Artificial Intelli, Casablanca, Morocco.;;"Qbadou, Mohammed/GRR-2681-2022; Qbadou, Mohammed/GRO-3663-2022";Qbadou, Mohammed/0000-0001-7822-1135;;;;;34;0;0;0;0;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

Within recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received profound attention within the field of E-learning. Persuasive principles can be implemented to enhance the system design and motivate students to engage with the system. The aim of this study is to identify students' motivation and learning strategies that affect their academic performance in using MOOCs among tertiary education students. 40 students enrolled in the Ethnic Relations course participated in the online survey. Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) is the instrument used in this study while Automatic Linear Modelling (ALM) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used in the analysis. The result shows that there is a correlation between students' motivation, learning strategies and their academic performance. It is found that resource management, cognitive and metacognitive and value component are the main scales that influenced their motivation and learning strategies towards excellent academic performance.

Social media is a new approach that is used to enhance and improve the delivery of education. Facebook groups and YouTube channels are the most operated networks that manage to deliver information. In this paper, we will study the impact of applying Facebook groups and YouTube videos on students' academic achievements in computer programming labs especially in object-oriented programming 2 (OOP2) lab at the Hashemite University. The practical programming lab plays an important role in understanding the theoretical programming concepts, for this reason programming lab is chosen as a case study. The proposed methodology embeds the social media networks as new major dimension in the teaching process of OOP2 Lab side by side with traditional lectures and e-learning tool such as Moodle. In this research: three surveys are utilized respectively to inspect the reasons of the weakness in OOP2 lab, evaluate the course learning outcomes (CLOs) by students before and after applying the proposed methodology and to investigate the opinions of students toward using social media networks within learning process.

Teachers might reduce the workload of the correction process and students achieve a better understanding of the subject by evaluating the activities of their peers. In order to ease the process, it is advisable to provide the students with a rubric over which performing the assessment of their peers; however, restricting themselves to provide only numerical scores is detrimental, as it prevents providing valuable feedback to others peers. Since this assessment produces two modalities of the same evaluation, namely numerical score and textual feedback, it is possible to apply automatic techniques to detect inconsistencies in the evaluation, thus minimizing the teachers' workload for supervising the whole process. This paper proposes a machine learning approach for the detection of such inconsistencies. To this end, we consider two different approaches, each of which is tested with different algorithms, in order to both evaluate the approach itself and find appropriate models to make it successful. The experiments carried out with 4 groups of students and 2 types of activities show that the proposed approach is able to yield reliable results, thus representing a valuable approach for ensuring a fair operation of the peer assessment process.";"[Ramon Rico-Juan, Juan; Gallego, Antonio-Javier; Calvo-Zaragoza, Jorge] Univ Alicante, Dept Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Carretera San Vicente Raspeig S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain";Universitat d'Alacant;Calvo-Zaragoza, J (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Carretera San Vicente Raspeig S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain.;"juanramonrico@ua.es; jgallego@dlsi.ua.es; jcalvo@dlsi.ua.es";"RICO-JUAN, Juan Ramón/AAQ-9737-2021; Gallego, Antonio Javier/AAE-3627-2019";"RICO-JUAN, Juan Ramón/0000-0002-9199-5802; Gallego, Antonio Javier/0000-0003-3148-6886; Calvo-Zaragoza, Jorge/0000-0003-3183-2232";Redes-I3CE de investigacion en docencia universitaria programme from Instituto de Ciencias de la Educacion de la Universidad de Alicante [REDES-I3CE-2018-4302];Redes-I3CE de investigacion en docencia universitaria programme from Instituto de Ciencias de la Educacion de la Universidad de Alicante;The present work was supported through Redes-I3CE de investigacion en docencia universitaria programme from Instituto de Ciencias de la Educacion de la Universidad de Alicante (Ref.: REDES-I3CE-2018-4302);;56;26;27;3;52;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Due to the complexity of the RIXS cross-section and strong core-hole effects, theoretical simulation of the experimental RIXS spectra is still a difficult task which hampers the understanding of RIXS spectra and the development of the RIXS technique. In this paper, we present an open source toolkit (dubbed EDRIXS) to facilitate the simulations of RIXS spectra of strongly correlated materials based on exact diagonalization (ED) of certain model Hamiltonians. The model Hamiltonian can be from a single atom, small cluster or Anderson impurity model, with model parameters from density functional theory plus Wannier90 or dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The spectra of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS are then calculated using Krylov subspace techniques. This toolkit contains highly efficient ED, XAS and RIXS solvers written in modern Fortran 90 language and a convenient Python library used to prepare inputs and set up calculations. We first give a short introduction to RIXS spectroscopy, and then we discuss the implementation details of this toolkit. Finally, we show three examples to demonstrate its usage.

This study aimed to explore a new-paradigm for creativity enhancement-improving creativity through the FACE (Feedback, Aesthetic experience, Creative design, and Evaluation of designed products) computer-based training program in which aesthetic experience and 3-D creative design were incorporated. Moreover, possible moderators such as emotional creativity (EC) and desire for aesthetics (DA) were investigated during the training. In concurrence with these endeavors, 76 college students participated in a control-group experimental design study investigating the effectiveness of the FACE training; it was invented to promote cognitive aesthetic enhancement and improve creative performance on a 3-D coffee shop design. In addition, inventories regarding emotional creativity (EC) and desire for aesthetics (DA) were employed. The findings suggest that the employed training program enhanced college students' aesthetic understanding, and further improved their creativity through both conscious and unconscious processes. Notably, training that included constructive feedback led to better learning effects than the condition that included informational feedback. Furthermore, emotional creativity (EC) and desire for aesthetics (DA) played moderating roles during the learning process of creativity. This study provides a new archetype for improving creativity and the results support the possibility and importance of integrating aesthetics and creativity enhancement in computer based learning systems for modern educational methods.";"[Yeh, Yu-chu; Rega, Elisa Marie; Chen, Szu-Yu] Natl Chengchi Univ, Inst Teacher Educ, 64 Zhinan Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 116, Taiwan; [Yeh, Yu-chu] Natl Chengchi Univ, Res Ctr Mind Brain & Learning, 64 Zhinan Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 116, Taiwan";"National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University";Yeh, YC (corresponding author), Natl Chengchi Univ, Inst Teacher Educ, 64 Zhinan Rd,Sect 2, Taipei 116, Taiwan.;"ycyeh@nccu.edu.tw; Elisa.rega@gmail.com; cindytaipeior@gmail.com";;Yeh, Yu-chu/0000-0002-0470-0368;Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 103-2511-S-004 -002-MY3];Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (Contract No. MOST 103-2511-S-004 -002-MY3).

Combining these assembles a rich digital footprint for students, which can enable institutions to better understand student behaviour and to better prepare for guiding students towards reaching their academic potential. This paper presents a newresearch methodology to automatically detect students at-risk of failing an assignment in computer programming modules (courses) and to simultaneously support adaptive feedback. By leveraging historical student data, we built predictive models using students' offline (static) information including student characteristics and demographics, and online (dynamic) resources using programming and behaviour activity logs. Predictions are generated weekly during semester. Overall, the predictive and personalised feedback helped to reduce the gap between the lower and higher-performing students. Furthermore, students praised the prediction and the personalised feedback, conveying strong recommendations for future students to use the system. We also found that students who followed their personalised guidance and recommendations performed better in examinations.;"[Azcona, David; Smeaton, Alan F.] Dublin City Univ, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Dublin, Ireland; [Hsiao, I-Han] Arizona State Univ, Sch Comp Informat & Decis Syst Engn, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA";"Dublin City University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe";Azcona, D (corresponding author), Dublin City Univ, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Dublin, Ireland.;"David.Azcona@insight-centre.org; Sharon.Hsiao@asu.edu; Alan.Smeaton@dcu.ie";Smeaton, Alan/F-8974-2011;Smeaton, Alan/0000-0003-1028-8389;"Irish Research Council; National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Ireland [GOIPG/2015/3497]; Science Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2289]; Fulbright Ireland; Irish Research Council (IRC) [GOIPG/2015/3497] Funding Source: Irish Research Council (IRC)";"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Ireland; Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland); Fulbright Ireland; Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)";This research was supported by the Irish Research Council in association with the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning in Ireland under project number GOIPG/2015/3497, by Science Foundation Ireland under grant number 12/RC/2289, and by Fulbright Ireland.

This study applied a content-based method for collecting and evaluating recently published studies relating to populations of students engaged in formal online programs and courses. Based on our findings, we identified key descriptors and processes that prove essential for defining online student populations and understanding their differences. This study offers a new conceptual model that consolidates certain prior typologies and frameworks of online learning. The model integrates key components and major processes derived from our study's findings. Our model thus synthesizes and classifies the major categories of antecedents and processes, and suggests relationships that directly or indirectly influence outcomes. The model also provides an integrated framework by which educators and institutions may develop better strategies and approaches for designing, developing, and delivering online education. This study and its model thus advance theory and contribute to educational practice and research in online learning. The study encourages more research specifically on student populations engaged in online learning. Our framework orients future studies that can generate more consistent, coherent data on antecedents of student populations and how population differences interrelate with processes to impact online learning outcomes.;"[Money, William H.; Dean, Benjamin P.] The Citadel, Tommy & Victoria Baker Sch Business, 171 Moultrie St,Bond Hall,Rm 370, Charleston, SC 29409 USA";;Dean, BP (corresponding author), The Citadel, Tommy & Victoria Baker Sch Business, 171 Moultrie St,Bond Hall,Rm 370, Charleston, SC 29409 USA.;bdean@citadel.edu;;Dean, Benjamin/0000-0002-6827-0643;;;;;146;26;35;1;71;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Moreover, because the existing PdM research is still in primary experimental stage, most works are conducted utilizing several open-datasets, and the combination with specific applications such as rotating machinery is especially rare. Hence, in this paper, we focus on data-driven methods for PdM, present a comprehensive survey on its applications, and attempt to provide graduate students, companies, and institutions with the preliminary understanding of the existing works recently published. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the PdM approach, illustrate our PdM scheme for automatic washing equipment, and demonstrate the challenges encountered when we conduct a PdM research. Second, we classify the specific industrial applications based on six algorithms of machine learning and deep learning (DL), and compare five performance metrics for each classification. Furthermore, the accuracy (a metric to evaluate the algorithm performance) of these PdM applications is analyzed in detail. There are some important conclusions: 1) the data used in the summarized literature are mostly from public datasets, such as case western reserve university (CWRU)/intelligent maintenance systems (IMS); and 2) in recent years, researchers seem to focus more on DL algorithms for PdM research.

Distillation, which involves mass transfer between vapor and liquid phases, is, by far, the most extended separation practice. However, the presence of azeotropes in most of the mixtures with industrial interest complicates the process analysis due to tedious and complex calculations, even in the simplest case of binary mixtures. Moreover, the need for recycle streams makes convergence and variables specification very difficult as compared with the separation of nonazeotropic mixtures. Initial training in process simulators results fundamentally in high-quality chemical engineering teaching programs. It yields a better understanding of enhanced distillation and entails the use of professional tools highly demanded by employers. This paper reports how the use of the commercial simulator Aspen Plus can help students explore azeotropic distillation by their own, and thus enables looking into aspects which are beyond the scope of problems solved by hand.;"[Roman, Claudia; Garcia-Morales, Moises] Univ Huelva, Dept Ingn Quim Quim Fis & Ciencias Mat, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21071, Spain";Universidad de Huelva;García-Morales, M (corresponding author), Univ Huelva, Dept Ingn Quim Quim Fis & Ciencias Mat, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Huelva 21071, Spain.;moises.garcia@diq.uhu.es;"García-Morales, Moisés/L-3720-2014; Roman, Claudia/O-5556-2014";"García-Morales, Moisés/0000-0003-4153-487X; Roman, Claudia/0000-0002-7960-5832";Catedra CEPSA de la Universidad de Huelva;Catedra CEPSA de la Universidad de Huelva;"Catedra CEPSA de la Universidad de Huelva, Grant/Award Number: Funding of ASPEN ONE licence; Vicerrectorado de Innovacion y Empleabilidad de la Universidad de Huelva, Grant/Award Number: XIX Convocatoria de Ayudas a la Innovacion Docente";;20;5;5;5;31;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Participants were initially unaware of the study. We deployed the billing problem, contest winner, and expiration date phishing tactics. Experiment 1 impersonated banking authorities; Experiment 2 enticed users with monetary rewards; and Experiment 3 threatened users with account cancelation. We found correlations resulting in lowered susceptibility based on college affiliation, academic year progression, cyber training, involvement in cyber clubs or cyber scholarship programs, time spent on the computer, and age demographics. We found no significant correlation between gender and susceptibility. Contrary to our expectations, we observed a reverse correlation between phishing awareness and student resistance to clicking. Students who identified themselves as understanding the definition of phishing had a higher susceptibility rate than did their peers who were merely aware of phishing attacks, with both groups having a higher susceptibility rate than those with no knowledge whatsoever.

The aforementioned recognized, soft skills training is still an incipient initiative in the engineering discipline. This paper aims to summarize the implementation of the Engineering Leadership Program at the School of Engineering, where the implementation process uses the model for learning and teaching proposed by Reyes and Zarama, 1998b, as a strategy to embody engineering leadership capabilities. The best practices in regard to the capabilities that promote engineering leadership are discussed. The final remarks highlight the relevance of the active student roles in the development of the Engineering Leadership Program. Design/methodology/approach The author describes the implementation of the Engineering Leadership Program using Reyes and Zarama's process of embodying distinctions. Findings The use of systemic models for teaching and learning in the implementation of Engineering Leadership Programs helps facilitate leadership competencies in students. The implementation of engineering leadership as complementary activity in the engineering curriculum demonstrated individual and program advantages - in comparison to solely modifying the current engineering curriculum.

In some occasions, they have to deal with the internals of memory management (pointers, pointer arithmetic, and heap management) facing a vision of programming from the low abstraction level offered by C. Even using C++ and references, not all scenarios where objects or collections of objects need to be managed can be covered. Based on the difficulties identified when dealing with such low-level abstractions, the C-Sim application, aimed at learning these concepts in an easy way, has been developed. To support the tool, the C programming language was selected. It allows showing concepts, remaining as close as possible both to the hardware and the operating system. To validate C-Sim, pre and posttests were filled in by a group of 60 first-year CS students, who employed the tool to learn about memory management. Grades of students using C-Sim were also obtained and compared with those that did not use the tool the former academic year. As main outcomes, 82.26% of students indicated that they had improved programming and memory management knowledge, and 83.64% pointed out that the use of this type of tools improves the understanding and quality of the practice lessons. Furthermore, the marks of students have significantly increased. Finally, C-Sim was designed from the ground up as a learning aid and can be useful for lecturers, who can complement their lessons using interactive demonstrations. Students can also employ it to experiment and learn autonomously.;"[Garcia Perez-Schofield, Baltasar; Garcia Rivera, Matias; Lado, Maria J.] Univ Vigo, Higher Sch Comp Sci Engn, Campus As Lagoas, Orense, Spain; [Ortin, Francisco] Univ Oviedo, Comp Sci Dept, Oviedo, Spain";"Universidade de Vigo; University of Oviedo";Lado, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Higher Sch Comp Sci Engn, Campus As Lagoas, Orense, Spain.;"jbgarcia@uvigo.es; mrpepa@uvigo.es";"Lado, María J./F-9196-2011; Ortin, Francisco/K-9272-2014; Garcia Perez-Schofield, Baltasar/S-1171-2017";"Lado, María J./0000-0002-9027-7788; Ortin, Francisco/0000-0003-1199-8649; Garcia Perez-Schofield, Baltasar/0000-0002-0603-2842";;;;;29;2;2;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Its benefits are more than evident, but also are its internal complexity. The widespread use of FPGA devices has created a necessity for understanding the inner logic using diagrams or theoretical explanations. This paper presents an innovative approach for FPGA basic architecture learning called GASIM. A conceptually complete model for a simple but general 2-D graphical FPGA has been designed and implemented in such a way that is easy to understand, aesthetically appealing from the student's point of view, and also easy to use by any teacher. The aim of this kind of design is to fill the conceptual gap we have found while teaching FPGA based courses. The final tool is a 2-D modular graphical library for a standalone logic simulator that not only allows teachers and students to program an FPGA model and simulate every aspect of its internal logic complexities but also to construct their own limited, but complete FPGA structure using drag and drop graphical modules and programmable interconnections. Our study provides a technical description of the tool, and our first results in the classroom.;"[De Castro, Osberth; Murrugarra, Cecilia] Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Elect & Circuits Engn, Caracas 1086, Venezuela; [De Castro, Osberth] Univ San Buenaventura, Program Multimedia Engn & Syst Engn, Bogota 110141, Colombia; [Murrugarra, Cecilia] Univ El Bosque, Elect Engn Program, Bogota 110121, Colombia";"Simon Bolivar University; Universidad El Bosque";"Murrugarra, C (corresponding author), Univ Simon Bolivar, Dept Elect & Circuits Engn, Caracas 1086, Venezuela.;Murrugarra, C (corresponding author), Univ El Bosque, Elect Engn Program, Bogota 110121, Colombia.";"odecastro@usbbog.edu.co; cmurrugarra@unbosque.edu.co";Murrugarra, Cecilia/ABE-6187-2020;"Murrugarra, Cecilia/0000-0001-9439-5418; De Castro Cuevas, Osberth Cristhian/0000-0003-4554-3271";Faculty of Engineering and Electronic Engineering Program of Universidad El Bosque [PFI-2017-EL-012];Faculty of Engineering and Electronic Engineering Program of Universidad El Bosque;This work was supported in part by the Faculty of Engineering and Electronic Engineering Program of Universidad El Bosque under Research Project PFI-2017-EL-012.;;22;0;0;1;1;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;;1932-8540;;IEEE REV IBEROAM TEC;IEEE Rev.

I first find that a one point increase in total score is associated with a 1.4 percentage point (2.1% of a s.e.) increase in the probability of completing a Ph.D. in 5 years, with a 1.0 percentage point (2.1% of a s.e.) increase in the probability of completing a Ph.D. in 10 years, and with a 1.4 percentage point increase (3% of a s.e.) in the probability of becoming a tenure-track professor 10 years after the competition. I then use the individual evaluator-candidate scores to provide evidence that male evaluators give higher scores than do female evaluators to students who complete their doctoral program in 5 years. Since there is no difference between scores given by male and female evaluators to candidates who become tenure-track professors, male evaluators seem more focused on shorter time to degree than are female evaluators.;[Chandler, Vincent] UQO, Gatineau, PQ, Canada;"University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais";Chandler, V (corresponding author), UQO, Gatineau, PQ, Canada.;vincent.chandler@uqo.ca;;;"Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec -Societe et Culture";"Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec -Societe et Culture";The author wishes to thank SSHRC for accepting to share information and is particularly indebted to Margaret Blakeney and Andreas Reichert for their help with the data.

While signal processing is the science behind many technologies used in our everyday life, students usually feel that the practical use of signal processing subjects is obscured due to their intensive theoretical perspective. In this context, audio signal processing is a discipline where many general signal processing concepts can be easily experienced with sound. Specifically, spatial audio, i.e., the manipulation of audio signals with the aim of capturing and/or recreating the spatial impression of sound, provides an excellent and appealing application framework for signal processing education. This paper presents SART3D, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that facilitates spatial audio and signal processing education by enabling students to focus on the implementation and testing of core algorithms and to experience their own results using real-time processing. The time required for other nonrelevant aspects, such as hardware and driver set-up or user interaction, is significantly reduced. Experience evaluated throughout four academic years and 45 students (25% female) indicate they felt particularly engaged when SART3D was included in the course, improving their performance and understanding of the subject. In this context, the four factors defined by the Student Course Engagement Questionnaire (skills, emotional, participation, and performance) were analyzed to assess engagement in its multiple dimensions.;"[Cobos, Maximo; Roger, Sandra] Univ Valencia, Dept Comp Sci, Avinguda Univ S-N, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain";University of Valencia;Cobos, M (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Comp Sci, Avinguda Univ S-N, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain.;maximo.cobos@uv.es;Roger, Sandra/W-4121-2017;"Roger, Sandra/0000-0003-4808-252X; Cobos, Maximo/0000-0001-7318-3192";;;;;51;3;3;0;14;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

In this study, we applied several supervised machine learning techniques to four years of data on 11,001 students, each with 35 associated features, admitted to a small liberal arts college in California to predict student college commitment decisions. By treating the question of whether a student offered admission will accept it as a binary classification problem, we implemented a number of different classifiers and then evaluated the performance of these algorithms using the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and area under the receiver operator curve. The results from this study indicate that the logistic regression classifier performed best in modeling the student college commitment decision problem, i.e., predicting whether a student will accept an admission offer, with an AUC score of 79.6%. The significance of this research is that it demonstrates that many institutions could use machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of their estimates of entering class sizes, thus allowing more optimal allocation of resources and better control over net tuition revenue.;"[Basu, Kanadpriya] SnackNation, 3534 Hayden Ave, Culver City, CA 90232 USA; [Basu, Treena; Buckmire, Ron; Lal, Nishu] Occidental Coll, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA";Occidental College;Basu, T (corresponding author), Occidental Coll, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.;"kanad.basu@snacknation.com; basu@oxy.edu; ron@oxy.edu; lal@oxy.edu";;Buckmire, Ron/0000-0002-7920-6671;"Occidental College Admissions Office; National Science Foundation";"Occidental College Admissions Office; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))";We would like to acknowledge and thank the Occidental College Admissions Office for providing the authors with data and other assistance with logistics.

The main objective of this study is to understand the evolution of NSDI development in Indonesia and then develop strategic directions for future implementation. We first characterized periods of current NSDI development based on the use of technology and identified problems that have occurred. To understand the problems' causes, we conducted a stakeholder analysis utilizing questionnaire surveys. In addition, we analyzed cost components allocated for NSDI operation. The results showed that stakeholders' low participation was caused by insufficient technological, financial, and human resources to manage geographic information. Subsequently, a strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis was conducted to determine proposed directions of the institutional and technical aspects. This research provides the framework for analyzing NSDI evolution in one country-Indonesia.

Optimal control theory has proven to be a successful tool in understanding ways to curtail the spread of infectious diseases by devising the optimal disease intervention strategies. In this paper, we describe how a reduced 'toy' model can extract the essentials of the dynamics of the VZV transmission and reactivation in case of the study of optimal paths of varicella immunization programs. Results obtained using different optimization approaches are compared with the ones of a more realistic age-structured model. The reduced model shows some unreliable predictions in regards of model time scales about herpes zoster dynamic; nevertheless, it is able to reproduce the main qualitative dynamic of the more realistic model to the different optimization problems, while requiring a minimal number of parameters to be identified.";"[Betta, Monica] IMT Sch Adv Studies, Piazza S Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Betta, Monica; Landi, Alberto] Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, Via G Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Manfredi, Piero] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Laurino, Marco] CNR, Inst Clin Physiol, Via Giuseppe Monizzi 1, I-56124 Pisa, Italy";"IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Pisa; University of Pisa; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR)";"Betta, M (corresponding author), IMT Sch Adv Studies, Piazza S Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.;Betta, M (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Informat Engn, Via G Caruso 16, I-56122 Pisa, Italy.";monica.betta@imtlucca.it;"Betta, Monica/AAK-2263-2021; LANDI, ALBERTO/CAE-9552-2022; Laurino, Marco/J-5360-2018; LANDI, ALBERTO/CAH-5069-2022; Laurino, Marco/AGS-4062-2022";"LANDI, ALBERTO/0000-0002-0105-5121; Laurino, Marco/0000-0003-4798-5196; LANDI, ALBERTO/0000-0002-0105-5121; Betta, Monica/0000-0002-5672-1638";;;;;27;1;1;1;8;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0140-0118;1741-0444;;MED BIOL ENG COMPUT;Med.

The field of learning analytics has been a common practice in research since last years due to their great possibilities in terms of learning improvement. Both, Big and Small data techniques support the analysis cycle of learning analytics and risk of students' failure prediction. Such possibilities can be a strong positive contribution to the field of computational practice such as programming. Our main objective was to help teachers in their assessments through to make those possibilities effective. Thus, we have developed a functional solution to categorize and understand students' behavior in programming activities based in Scratch. Through collection and analysis of data generated by students' clicks in Scratch, we proceed to execute both exploratory and predictive analytics to detect patterns in students' behavior when developing solutions for assignments. We concluded that resultant taxonomy could help teachers to better support their students by giving real-time quality feedback and act before students deliver incorrectly or at least incomplete tasks.

The authors hope to create awareness to help improve equity in learning opportunities and assist educators in understanding the needs of multigenerational classrooms. Design/methodology/approach In a narrative review of the literature, the authors present the current findings of the literature on generations in higher education and concerns for equity in learning opportunities. Findings It is commonplace in undergraduate programs for learners of multiple generations to attend classes together and research has shown that historical context and generational experiences affect the values, attitudes and learning preferences of each generation. Therefore, higher education institutions should be aware of the demographic profile of their students, as well as the external populations from which they may recruit students, to ensure they are cognizant of the needs of these populations and can provide equality in learning opportunities. Originality/value Often when we think of diversity in the classroom we think of age, gender, race or even culture. Today we must add diversity in generations. Unlike other equity issues in education such as access (McLaughlin, 2010), educators may not be considering the equity in the design of their instruction to provide equitable learning experiences based on a learners' knowledge and skills established by their experiences with technology. The lack of knowledge and skills a learner has with technology based on their experiences may create barriers to their ability to understand and complete instructional content involving technology (Wager, 2005). To ensure all learners can be successful, educators should strive to provide equality in learning opportunities when designing instruction including technology.;"[Lowell, Victoria Lynn] Purdue Univ, Coll Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Morris, James Michael, Jr.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA";"Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University";Lowell, VL (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Coll Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;vllowell@purdue.edu;Lowell, Victoria/L-3832-2018;Lowell, Victoria/0000-0002-0300-5304;;;;;70;13;24;1;24;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2056-4880;;;INT J INF LEARN TECH;Int.

This brings to the fore the need for a flexible and accurate fusion algorithm that can be versatile. The Brooks-Iyengar algorithm is one such fusion algorithm. It has since its inception found numerous applications that deal with the fusion of data from multiple sources. The uniqueness of the Brooks-Iyengar algorithm is the ease with which the data from multiple sensors in a local system can be fused and also reach consensus in a distributed system with the added capability of fault tolerance. Blockchain has found its use as a distributed ledger and has successfully supported and fueled many crypto-currencies over the years. Information fusion with regards to Blockchains is a topic of great research interest in the past couple of years. Since blockchain has no official node, the introduction of a decentralized network and a consensus algorithm is required in making the interactions and exchanges between multiple suppliers easier and thus leads to business being carried out without any hassles. In this paper, we attempt to understand and describe the deployment of multiple sensors to measure various aspects of the physical world. We discuss a novel technique of employing the Brooks-Iyengar algorithm in the design of the system that would decentralize the data source from the corresponding measurements and thus ensure the integrity of the transactions in the Blockchain. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the performance of the algorithm when used in a blockchain based decentralized environment is also discussed.;"[Iyengar, Sitharama S.; Ramani, Sanjeev Kaushik] Florida Int Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Ao, Buke] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Dept Informat & Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China";"State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications";"Iyengar, SS (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.;Ao, B (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Dept Informat & Commun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.";"iyengar@cis.fiu.edu; skaus004@fiu.edu; aobuke@hotmail.com";;, Buke/0000-0003-1476-4194;US Army Research Office [W911NF-15-10572];US Army Research Office;This research was funded by the US Army Research Office under the grant number W911NF-15-10572.;;14;3;3;0;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2224-2708;;;J SENS ACTUAR NETW;J.

Consequently, a study about the workings of online social networks may help in understanding the structure of human society and the characteristics of generic complex networks. Over the past few years, interest in neighboring nodes, which are the number of nodes between any two nodes, the number of neighbors and how many triangles are present in a social network have produced the concepts of a six-degree separation (Milgram, Psychol Today 2(1):60-67, 1967; Backstrom et al., Proceedings of the 4th annual ACM web science conference, p 33-42, 2012), a heavy tail in the degree distribution (Barabasi, Albert, Science 286(5439):509-512, 1999) and a high clustering coefficient (Luce, Perry, Psychometrika 14(2):95-116, 1949; Watts, Strogatz, Nature 393(6684):440-442, 1998; Amaral et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97(21):11149-11152, 2000). In a similar manner, researchers have also been curious about how many polygons are present in a given online social network. Although much effort has been expended (Dantzig et al., International symposium on theory of graphs, p 77-83, 1967; Kamae, IEEE Trans Circuit Theory 14(2):166-171, 1967; Gotlieb, Corneil, Commun ACM 10(12):780-783, 1967; Welch, J ACM 13(2):205-210, 1966; Tiernan, Commun ACM 13(12):722-726, 1970; Tarjan, SIAM J Comput 2(3):211-216, 1973; Johnson, SIAM J Comput 4:77-84, 1975; Mateti, Deo, SIAM J Comput 5(5):90-99, 1976; Marinari et al., Europhys Lett 73(3):301-307, 2005), studying this subject, the inability to enumerate polygons has stymied an in depth understanding of the properties of polygons in an online social network. In the study described in this paper, the estimated number of polygons in an online social network is revealed. It was found that in the current widely used online social networks, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, the number of polygons increases drastically when the length of a polygon is below a set value and then it decreases rapidly. The average length of the network polygons was calculated and it was found that online social networks contain a relatively large average length of polygons. Based on this perspective, a massive labyrinth of polygons would make the online social networks appear to be very complicated. To further investigate this area, a generalized clustering coefficient was explored. Results showed that the generalized clustering coefficient appeared to descend exponentially with the length of polygon and expeditiously approached zero. This result suggested that the polygons with large lengths should be ignored in many scenarios. Since the polygons with lengths greater than five appeared to have little impact on the network, the online social networks appeared to be less complex than anticipated. The polygon is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory and complex networks, so that the work reported here may be beneficial for many disciplines, including transportation [7], engineering [8], computer science [9-16], physics (Birmele et al., Proceedings of the 24th annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, p 1884-1896, 2013), sociology (Motter, Albert, Phys Today 65:43, 2012), epidemiology (Feld, Am J Sociol 96(6):1464-1477, 1991; Cohen et al., Phys Rev Lett 91(24):12343, 2002), psychology (Sun et al., Sci Rep 4(6188):5099-5099, 2014), biology (Feiler, Kleinbaum, Psychol Sci, 2015), medicine (Kincaid, Pilette, Comput Appl Biosci Cabios 8:267-273, 1992), geography (Kim et al., Lancet 386(9989):145-153, 2015), etc.";"[Zhou, Xiaoping; Liang, Xun; Zhao, Jichao; Zhiyuli, Aakas] Renmin Univ China, Sch Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaoping] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Beijing Key Lab Intelligent Proc Bldg Big Data, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haiyan] Ningxia Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yinchuan, Ningxia, Peoples R China";"Renmin University of China; Beijing University of Civil Engineering & Architecture; Ningxia University";Liang, X (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Informat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"lukefchou@gmail.com; xliang@ruc.edu.cn; zhaojichao@ruc.edu.cn; zhiyulee@ruc.edu.cn; zhanghy_meng@126.com";"Zhang, Haiyan/GMW-7284-2022; li, aakas/KEZ-9616-2024";Liang, Xun/0000-0002-3431-5954;"Natural Science Foundation of China [71531012, 71601013, 61762073]; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing [4172032, 4174087]; Scientific Research Project of Beijing Educational Committee [SQKM201710016002]";"Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Scientific Research Project of Beijing Educational Committee";This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under grant nos. 71531012, 71601013 and 61762073, the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing under grant nos. 4172032 and 4174087, and the Scientific Research Project of Beijing Educational Committee under grand no.

This highlights the paramount importance of improving the teaching of electronics, especially in the first years of Bachelor's degrees in engineering. However, despite the fact that the teaching programs have been periodically renewed with more practical sessions, the students' outcomes are still noticeably low. So far, results only confirm improvements in the students' performance in the resolution of electronic circuits. Nonetheless, this is generally subject to the application of repetitive circuit resolution models, to the detriment of the real and active understanding of electronic principles. In this context, this study assesses the actual efficacy of different ICT (Information, Communication and Technology) resources, introduced into an electronics course, taught in an engineering Bachelor's degree, within the Spanish official university system. These resources have been sequentially introduced during five consecutive years. We have conducted a statistical analysis to infer whether all the resources are equally relevant for the achievement of the students or not. In addition, we have designed a survey to measure the perceived improvement in the understanding of concepts, acquired competences, and reported satisfaction and attitude towards the use of specific resources during the program. Amongst others, LMS (Learning Management System) support, online PBL (Problem-Based Learning) activities, and CSA (Circuit Simulation Applets) have been considered. Overall, the designed learning program has been intended to provide students with long-term references to enrich their resources' background regarding electronics.;"[Valiente, David; Paya, Luis; Reinoso, Oscar] Miguel Hernandez Univ, Syst Engn & Automat Dept, Elche 03202, Alicante, Spain; [Valiente, David; Fernandez de Avila, Susana; Ferrer, Juan C.] Miguel Hernandez Univ, Commun Engn Dept, Elche 03202, Alicante, Spain";"Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche";"Valiente, D (corresponding author), Miguel Hernandez Univ, Syst Engn & Automat Dept, Elche 03202, Alicante, Spain.;Valiente, D (corresponding author), Miguel Hernandez Univ, Commun Engn Dept, Elche 03202, Alicante, Spain.";"dvaliente@umh.es; lpaya@umh.es; s.fdezavila@umh.es; jc.ferrer@umh.es; o.reinoso@umh.es";"Ferrer, Juan Carlos/GZL-5366-2022; Paya, Luis/AGO-9630-2022; Valiente, David/ABG-8347-2020; Paya, Luis/I-5178-2015; Reinoso, Oscar/L-2236-2014";"Ferrer, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8382-777X; Valiente, David/0000-0002-2245-0542; Paya, Luis/0000-0002-3045-4316; Reinoso, Oscar/0000-0002-1065-8944";"Spanish Government [DPI2016-78361-R]; Valencian Research Council [AICO/2017/148]; European Social Fund [APOSTD/2017/028]";"Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Valencian Research Council; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF))";"This research was funded by: the Spanish Government through the project DPI2016-78361-R (AEI/FEDER, UE); the Valencian Research Council through the project AICO/2017/148; the Valencian Research Council and the European Social Fund through the post-doctoral grant APOSTD/2017/028, held by D.

The educational program, created in digital learning rooms of the Higher Engineering Education Alliance Program (HEEAP) program supported by Arizona State University, became a pioneer in teaching learners to work within the community. First, the combination of a novel instructional strategy and an integrated education in which project-based approach is employed to apply the technical knowledge. During this, students in mechatronics, computer science, and mechanics must collaborate with peers from industrial systems engineering. Second, in this paper, the design of an open structure connecting multi-disciplinary major is illustrated with a new teaching approach. It is proved to be better by combining specialized understandings of various types in a wide range of applications. From this basis support, participants could implement additional components quickly while keeping the cost low, making the products feasible and user-friendly. Last but not least, students are facilitated with a free library that helps to control simply despite lacking experience in robotics or automation. Several examples show that students are capable of developing things by themselves on open design.

However, test suites are in essence input-output specifications and are thus typically inadequate for completely specifying the expected behavior of the program under repair. Consequently, the patches generated by test suite based repair techniques can just overfit to the used test suite, and fail to generalize to other tests. We deeply analyze the overfitting problem in program repair and give a classification of this problem. This classification will help the community to better understand and design techniques to defeat the overfitting problem. We further propose and evaluate an approach called UnsatGuided, which aims to alleviate the overfitting problem for synthesis-based repair techniques with automatic test case generation. The approach uses additional automatically generated tests to strengthen the repair constraint used by synthesis-based repair techniques. We analyze the effectiveness of UnsatGuided: 1) analytically with respect to alleviating two different kinds of overfitting issues; 2) empirically based on an experiment over the 224 bugs of the Defects4J repository. The main result is that automatic test generation is effective in alleviating one kind of overfitting, issue-regression introduction, but due to oracle problem, has minimal positive impact on alleviating the other kind of overfitting issue-incomplete fixing.";"[Yu, Zhongxing; Danglot, Benjamin; Durieux, Thomas] Inria Lille Nord Europe, Ave Halley, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Martinez, Matias] Univ Valenciennes, Malvache Bldg,Campus Mont Houy, F-59313 Valenciennes 9, France; [Monperrus, Martin] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Commun, Stockholm, Sweden";"Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France; Royal Institute of Technology";Yu, ZX (corresponding author), Inria Lille Nord Europe, Ave Halley, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.;"zhoyu@kth.se; matias.martinez@univ-valenciennes.fr; benjamin.danglot@inria.fr; thomas.durieux@inria.fr; martin.monperrus@csc.kth.se";"Monperrus, Martin/I-3640-2012; Yu, Zhongxing/AAH-1064-2019; Durieux, Thomas/AAM-9269-2020; Martinez, Matias/ABA-8871-2021";"Monperrus, Martin/0000-0003-3505-3383; Durieux, Thomas/0000-0002-1996-6134; Martinez, Matias/0000-0002-2945-866X; Yu, Zhongxing/0000-0003-3718-8476";;;;;62;35;38;0;15;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

The parametric definitions of curves and surfaces in geometrical modelling are based on matrices which are found to be useful when used for the geometrical design of hydraulic structures. The LabVIEW matrices, through the use of the build array functions, the build matrix functions, and the 3D parametric surface functions are used for achieving the purpose of designing this software. The LabVIEW matrices enable the designer to change the hydraulic design parameters very easily and quickly to obtain more reliable and more accurate 2D and 3D designs. With LabVIEW it is not required to write a program instead a block diagram is necessary to be designed for achieving a certain required engineering task which is much simpler than writing a program especially when the task is complicated. When used for class room demonstration, the environment of the program and its visual artifacts enabled the students to enhance their understandings regarding the design of spillway and energy dissipater structures.

The programming courses are taught by applying a traditional learning method in which the programming concepts are explained theoretically and minimal practical work is applied. In addition, students receive either no formative feedback or minimal manual delayed feedback after submitting their practical work. This negatively affects students performance as students find it difficult to understand the programming concepts. This paper addresses the aforementioned drawbacks by applying blended learning for the first time to the C programming course which is taught to more than 1000 students each year at An-Najah National University, Palestine. Blended learning is a hybrid learning method which integrates the traditional learning method with technology and online learning. It provides students with more practical work and automated immediate formative feedback. This paper aims to study the effect of blended learning on students performance, and students satisfaction with the blended learning method. An independent experimental design was applied on 1374 undergraduate students enrolled in C programming course. Students were divided into two groups based on the learning method. The first group consisted of 632 students who studied the course using the traditional learning method, while the second group consisted of 742 students in which blended learning was applied. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied and the results revealed that blended learning improved student performance significantly compared with traditional learning. In addition, the results revealed that students were satisfied with the blended learning method in terms of easiness to use and suitability for programming and submitting assignments.;"[Demaidi, Mona Nabil; Qamhieh, Manar; Afeefi, Asmaa] An Najah Natl Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Nablus, Palestine";An Najah National University;Demaidi, MN (corresponding author), An Najah Natl Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Nablus, Palestine.;m.demaidi@najah.edu;Demaidi, Mona Nabil/KWT-6743-2024;Demaidi, Mona Nabil/0000-0001-8161-4992;Palestine Ministry of Education and Higher Education and An-Najah National University [ANNU-MoHE-1819-Sc006];Palestine Ministry of Education and Higher Education and An-Najah National University;This work was supported by the Palestine Ministry of Education and Higher Education and An-Najah National University under Grant ANNU-MoHE-1819-Sc006.;;46;11;12;4;53;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2019;7;;;;;;156824;156833;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949927;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949927;;;10;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";JN8TY;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000497165400118;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Elgendi, M;;;;Elgendi, Mohamed;;;Characteristics of a Highly Cited Article: A Machine Learning Perspective;IEEE ACCESS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Natural language processing; text mining; artificial intelligence; scientific writing; citation analysis; bibliometrics";"TITLES; NUMBER";Machine learning (ML) is a fast-growing topic that enables the extraction of patterns from varying types of datasets, ranging from medical data to financial data. However, the application of the ML methodology to understand the key characteristics of highly cited research articles has not been thoroughly investigated, despite the potential practical guidance that ML can provide for researchers during the publication process. To address this research gap, an ML algorithm known as principal component (PC) analysis is used to detect patterns in highly and lowly cited papers. In this paper, eight features (number of citations, number of views, number of characters with no spaces, number of figures, number of tables, number of equations, number of authors, and title length) are extracted from highly and lowly cited papers, leading to eight PCs (PC1-PC8). PC1 shows that the numbers of citations are positively correlated with the character count and negatively correlated with the title length.

To bridge this gap, we use signaling theory to investigate the impacts that the business analytics breadth (BAB) level and university ranking of MBA programs have on graduates' future employment success in terms of salary and job placement. We collected and analyzed data on business analytics-relevant courses that the top 89 business schools in the United States according to Bloomberg (bloomberg.com) offered. Our findings show the vital role of university ranking in determining the efficacy of BAB to produce job market gains for students: university ranking moderated the effect of business analytics offerings on post-graduation salary and job placement.

Several studies have shown the benefits of visual languages for learning purposes and their applicability to robot programming. However, at present, there are not enough comparative studies on the suitability of textual and visual languages for this purpose. In this paper, we study if, as with a textual language, the use of a visual language could also be suitable in the context of robot programming and, if so, what the main advantages of using a visual language would be. For our experiments, we selected a sample of 60 individuals among students with adequate knowledge of procedural programming, that was divided into three groups. For the first group of 20 students, a learning scenario based on a textual object-oriented language was used for programming a specific commercial robotic ball with sensing, wireless communication, and output capabilities, whereas for the second and the third group, two learning scenarios based on visual languages were used for programming the robot. After taking a course for programming the robot in the corresponding learning scenario, each group was evaluated by completing three programming exercises related to the robot features (i.e. motion, lighting, and collision detection). Our results show that the students that worked with visual languages perceived a higher clarity level in their understanding of the course exposition, and a higher enjoyment level in the use of the programming environment.

Moreover, it has potential applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis), education (understanding student frustration), and more. In Addition, ERC is also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an understanding of the user's emotions. Catering to these needs calls for effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However, it is a difficult problem to solve because of several research challenges.

This is understandable because accreditation not only leads to better content and delivery of these programs but also allows these institutes to acquire good quality students and faculty members. One respectable body that has the mandate to accredit computing programs is the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). In this paper, we provide the details of our assessment and evaluation strategies for ABET-defined student outcomes (SOs) of computer science and computer information systems programs. The assessment is mainly carried out through a range of direct and indirect assessment methods, including summative data analysis, formative data analysis, exit exam, faculty survey, and alumni survey. Then, data gathered from these sources is aggregated and analyzed to quantify the attainment of SOs. This also forms the basis of the continuous improvement process activities that are the cornerstone of any accreditation-related activity. While presenting this, this paper provides details on the challenges that were faced during the process. The most important contribution includes strategies that were adopted to tackle these issues. A unique aspect of our institute is the academic environment that consists of segregated male and female students and faculty members in order to respect the cultural norms of the society.

It considers pedagogical structure and phenomenological dimensions over an array of study abroad and immersive learning conditions. This paper illustrates rich and impactful ways that learning can unfold, including the unintended consequences of education that opens eyes, changes perspectives and builds empathy. Methodology This paper deploys a case study method whereby three unique programs for studio education are critically considered/analyzed. The research connects cases and delineates approaches in environmental design, whereby greater understanding and deeper knowledge can be attained. Findings This paper, through study of cases of immersive learning, reveals effective ways in which studio teaching can serve to heighten sensitivity, construct rich self/world views and render visible more profound knowledge. Such knowledge transcends disciplinary boundaries and professional borders - encompassing a fuller spectrum of awareness that includes the social, the cultural and the spiritual. Research limitations/implications This paper investigates studio-based graduate education in Environmental Design, with a particular focus on Architecture/Planning. As such, there are limitations to the applicability of discoveries and revelations. That said, the general model for teaching and learning may have value across disciplines well beyond those examined in the current research. Practical implications In an increasingly complex world, where cultures and values routinely collide, the research presents pedagogical approaches that promise to erode walls, dissolve barriers and counter fragmentation. The case studies illustrate effective ways to heighten learning beyond the ethos of traditional classes and conventional classrooms. Originality/value This paper proffers bold creative models for teaching that defy everyday strategies. It encourages moving students to places/spaces, both concrete and abstract, that challenge their assumptions, test their capabilities and permit exceptional personal/professional growth.;[Sinclair, Brian Robert] Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, Calgary, AB, Canada;University of Calgary;Sinclair, BR (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Environm Design, Calgary, AB, Canada.;brian.sinclair@ucalgary.ca;;;;;;;14;1;1;1;6;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0368-492X;1758-7883;;KYBERNETES;Kybernetes;;2019;48;2;;;SI;;318;332;;10.1108/K-02-2018-0089;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-02-2018-0089;;;15;Computer Science, Cybernetics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;HM6EE;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000459566000007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, first, we give an improved evacuation model based on cellular automata, which consists of the static floor field and the dynamic floor field. Then, we present the detailed algorithms for calculating both the floor fields. The static floor field is calculated using an A-star algorithm, which can be used to solve the evacuation environments with and without obstacles. The dynamic floor field is calculated based on the impact of the number of pedestrians in each exit area on evacuation. Finally, the calculation method of pedestrian movement probability and the model evolution rules are given. The simulation experiments using our model have been conducted, and comparisons between our model and some state-of-the-art evacuation models are also conducted. The experimental results show that the model is effective and can reproduce the evacuation experiments conducted by students well. The model is expected to yield the optimal evacuation plan from the indoor environment.;"[Song, Peihua; Jia, Jinyuan] Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Song, Peihua; Li, Wenjing] Nanning Normal Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Nanning 530299, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yan] UTHSC, Dept Genet Genom & Informat, Memphis, TN 38103 USA; [Xue, Yu] Guangxi Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Luo, Wei] UCAS, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China";"Tongji University; Nanning Normal University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; Guangxi University";Jia, JY (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.;jiajytj@126.com;Gao, Yan/ISU-7881-2023;Jia, Jinyuan/0000-0002-7772-4766;"National Natural Science Foundation, China [61866006, 11262003]; Guangxi Innovation-Driven Development of Special Funds Project, China [AA17204091]; Guangxi Nanning Science and Technology Development Planning Project, China [20181015-5]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi, China [2018GXNSFAA138205]";"National Natural Science Foundation, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangxi Innovation-Driven Development of Special Funds Project, China; Guangxi Nanning Science and Technology Development Planning Project, China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province)";This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation, China, under Grant 61866006 and Grant 11262003, in part by the Guangxi Innovation-Driven Development of Special Funds Project, China, under Grant AA17204091, in part by the Guangxi Nanning Science and Technology Development Planning Project, China, under Grant 20181015-5, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi, China, under Grant 2018GXNSFAA138205.;;26;8;10;6;37;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2019;7;;;;;;98694;98701;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930251;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930251;;;8;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";IP8WF;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000480326700043;View Full Record in Web of Science

This important equipment needs to be understood and mastered through biological experiments. However, in actual experimental teaching in China, microscope samples are difficult to produce, preserve and share, and the implementation status is not ideal. These conditions seriously affect student enthusiasm and require additional participant labor. Moreover, they hinder teachers evaluation of experimental learning. Thus, this paper constructs a smart microscope physical interaction kit for secondary school biology experiments. First, the main components of the traditional microscope are replaced by a variety of different sensing elements, which are 3D printed. Then, a novel multichannel information integration strategy based on visual, auditory and tactile information is proposed to manage different channels of information, to understand the users operational intent and to organize reasonable interactions (including the display of real-time adjustment effects). Then, we propose a navigational interaction paradigm based on multimodal intent understanding, aiming at reminding users of invalid behavior and providing necessary operational guidance for users, thus achieving the purpose of intelligent interaction and intelligent experimental teaching. The experimental results show that the proposed microscope kit, multichannel integration strategy and navigation interaction algorithm not only imbue microscopy experiments with the characteristics of intelligent interaction but also stimulate student enthusiasm and help the evaluation of experimental learning.

In the human brain plan, the neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment in diseases and aging are one of the key areas of concern. However, lead is an environmental heavy metal neurotoxin, which can cause neurodegenerative diseases and affect brain health. At present, the mechanism of the lead-induced nervous system damage mainly focuses on the damage of lead to neurons, while the researches related to the repair of damaged nerve cells induced by the lead exposure have not been reported. The Transcriptome sequencing technology is direct detection of transcripts by the deep sequencing technology, which can more accurately measure the expression of transcripts, and is an inevitable link between genomic genetic information and the proteome of biological functions. In addition, the regulation of the transcription level is the most important regulation mode of organisms. Based on the characteristics of neurogenesis for nerve repair, the current study applied transcriptional sequencing technology to screen the differentially expressed genes in the choroid plexus of rats and to explore the changes in the expression of neurotrophic factors regulating neurogenesis in the choroid plexus of the lead-exposed rats. The results showed that the differentially expressed genes on choroid plexus of the lead exposed rats were related to neurogenesis. In the process of neurogenesis, the expression of nutritive and growth-promoting factors IGF1, EGFr, IGF1r, EGFr1, VEGF alpha, and TGF beta 2 decreased, which suggested that these cytokines may be involved in the process of lead exposure neurogenesis, which needs further experimental verification. The findings of this study provide a new target for the mechanism research and prevention and control measures of brain nerve injury caused by the lead exposure.;"[Xue, Ling; Chen, Meng; Yan, Li-Cheng; Bo, Jian-Zhu; Wang, Jian-Bo; Zhang, Yan-Shu] North China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Tangshan 063210, Peoples R China";North China University of Science & Technology;Zhang, YS (corresponding author), North China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Publ Hlth, Tangshan 063210, Peoples R China.;yanshuzhang@nest.edu.cn;"fang, yu/KCK-2014-2024; guo, ppdop/KAL-9865-2024";;National Natural Science Foundation of China [81373033];National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 81673208 and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 81373033.;;52;1;1;1;20;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2019;7;;;;;;18206;18218;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896169;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896169;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";HM6SH;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000459607400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Such contextual-sensitive features and patterns are of high interest to be discovered and analyzed in order to obtain the right meaning. This paper formulates the problem of mining context-aware association rules, which refers to the search for associations between itemsets such that the strength of their implication depends on a contextual feature. For the discovery of this type of associations, a model that restricts the search space and includes syntax constraints by means of a grammar-based genetic programming methodology is proposed. Grammars can be considered as a useful way of introducing subjective knowledge to the pattern mining process as they are highly related to the background knowledge of the user. The performance and usefulness of the proposed approach is examined by considering synthetically generated datasets. A posteriori analysis on different domains is also carried out to demonstrate the utility of this kind of associations. For example, in educational domains, it is essential to identify and understand contextual and context-sensitive factors that affect overall and individual student behavior and performance. The results of the experiments suggest that the approach is feasible and it automatically identifies interesting context-aware associations from real-world datasets.;"[Maria Luna, Jose; Jose del Jesus, Maria] Univ Jaen, Dept Comp Sci, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Pechenizkiy, Mykola] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci, NL-5600 Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Ventura, Sebastian] Univ Cordoba, Dept Comp Sci & Numer Anal, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Ventura, Sebastian] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia";"Universidad de Jaen; Eindhoven University of Technology; Universidad de Cordoba; King Abdulaziz University";Ventura, S (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Comp Sci & Numer Anal, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain.;"jmluna@uco.es; m.pechenizkiy@tue.nl; mjjesus@ujaen.es; sventura@uco.es";"Del Jesus, Maria Jose/AAB-1432-2019; Ventura, Sebastian/A-7753-2008; Luna, Jose Maria/K-4893-2014";"Del Jesus, Maria Jose/0000-0002-7891-3059; Ventura, Sebastian/0000-0003-4216-6378; Pechenizkiy, Mykola/0000-0003-4955-0743; Luna, Jose Maria/0000-0003-3537-2931";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund [TIN-2014-55252-P, TIN2015-68454-R]; STW Context-Aware Predictive Analytics Project";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); STW Context-Aware Predictive Analytics Project";This work was supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund under Project TIN-2014-55252-P and Project TIN2015-68454-R, and in part by the STW Context-Aware Predictive Analytics Project.;;33;22;23;0;11;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2168-2267;2168-2275;;IEEE T CYBERNETICS;IEEE T.

This study attempts to examine whether flipped classroom, with reference to self-regulation principles, is a good pedagogy for enhancing formative learning outcomes for first year university students. A total of 73 students, enrolled on a teacher education program, participated in this study. Data were collected from different sources in three phases. In the first phase, data were collected from pre- and post-tests, and the number of viewings of the assigned online videos were logged. Techniques in editing images applied by the group and the individual were examined in the second phase. Finally, opinions related to flipped classroom were collected from focus group interviews in the third phase. The results suggest that students are able to apply their self-learned knowledge to editing images both together and individually. They were very positive about flipped classroom activities and all 7 self-regulated (SR) learning principles were achieved. While students embraced the flexibility of learning online, they missed the face-to-face interaction with the teacher and their learning peers. This was especially the case when they did not understand the content of the online videos. This study provides an additional lens of SR principles.;[Ng, Eugenia M.

Among them, screencasts (i.e. desktop video recordings of presentations normally accompanied by the presenter's video and narration), constitute a pedagogical tool used to create visual material to be distributed to students. Learners can then watch the videos in their own convenience and pace. The plethora of tools available makes it easier for the teachers to produce high-quality, low-cost screencasts for a number of courses. In the current paper we investigate how students perceive the impact of screencasts on their understanding and motivation in learning Logic Programming. We take the opportunity to present some tips and techniques that can be applied in any screencast production. We discuss in detail how screencasts can be used in programming courses, irrespectively of whether the latter use Imperative, Object-Oriented, or Declarative languages, and we present a number of examples to demonstrate how screencasts can facilitate learning. Furthermore, we focus particularly on Logic Programming, which lends itself to technology enhanced learning, since it requires a non-linear, out-of-the-box way of thinking towards developing programs.

Using TSGL, an instructor (or student) can create parallel visualizations that clearly show the parallel patterns or techniques a given program is using, allowing students to see the parallel behavior in near real-time as the program is running.

The main focus of the course is on the shared-memory programming paradigm, which facilitates the presentation of fundamental aspects and notions of parallel computing. Unlike the traditional loop-based approach, which is the focus of parallel programming courses in other universities, this course presents the parallel programming concepts using a task-based approach. Tasking allows students to explore a broader set of parallel decomposition strategies, including linear, iterative and recursive strategies, and their implementation using the current version of OpenMP (OpenMP 4.5), which offers mechanisms (pragmas and intrinsic functions) to easily map these strategies into parallel programs. Simple models to understand the benefits of a task decomposition and the trade-offs introduced by different kinds of overheads are included in the course, together with the use of tools that allow an easy exploration of different task decomposition strategies and their potential parallelism (Toreador) and instrumentation and analysis of task parallel executions on real machines (Extrae and Paraver).

Multispectral surveys were performed on a plant nursery to produce Digital Surface Models and orthophotos with ground sample distance equal to 0.01 m. Different combinations of multispectral images, multi-temporal data, and texture measures were employed to improve classification. The Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix was used to generate texture images with different window sizes and procedures for optimal texture features and window size selection were investigated. The study evaluates how methods used in Remote Sensing could be applied on ultra-high resolution UAS images. Combinations of original and derived bands were classified with the Maximum Likelihood algorithm, and Principal Component Analysis was conducted in order to understand the correlation between bands. The study proves that the use of texture features produces a significant increase of the Overall Accuracy, whose values change from 58% to 78% or 87%, depending on components reduction. The improvement given by the introduction of texture measures is highlighted even in terms of User's and Producer's Accuracy.

Within educational applications, recent empirical research has shown that signal-level features of students' writing, such as stroke distance, pressure and duration, are adapted to conserve total energy expenditure as they consolidate expertise in a domain. The present research examined how accurately three different machine-learning algorithms could automatically classify users' domain expertise based on signal features of their writing, without any content analysis. Compared with an unguided machine-learning classification accuracy of 71%, hybrid methods using empirical-statistical guidance correctly classified 79-92% of students by their domain expertise level. In addition to improved accuracy, the hybrid approach contributed a causal understanding of prediction success and generalization to new data.

This gives designers and implementers augmented flexibility; however, it requires an extra effort to understand the rules that drove the use of alternative schemata when sets of documents with different -and possibly conflicting- schemata are to be analyzed or integrated. In this paper we propose a technique, called schema profiling, to explain the schema variants within a collection in document-oriented databases by capturing the hidden rules explaining the use of these variants. We express these rules in the form of a decision tree (schema profile). Consistently with the requirements we elicited from real users, we aim at creating explicative, precise, and concise schema profiles. The algorithm we adopt to this end is inspired by the well-known C4.5 classification algorithm and builds on two original features: the coupling of value-based and schema-based conditions within schema profiles, and the introduction of a novel measure of entropy to assess the quality of a schema profile. A set of experimental tests made on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using game mechanics and a student-generated questions strategy to promote algorithmic thinking skills in an online puzzle-based game learning system. An online puzzle-based game learning system, TGTS (Turtle Graphics Tutorial System), was developed to help students learn algorithmic thinking skills by allowing them to solve puzzles. A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of using game mechanics alone and using game mechanics plus a student generated questions strategy. Nine fourth-grade elementary classes (n = 242) were used to form three treatment groups, including one without game mechanics, one using game mechanics, and one using game mechanics plus a student-generated questions strategy. The results indicate that TGTS with game mechanics significantly enhanced algorithmic thinking skills and puzzle-solving performance. Furthermore, although TGTS with game mechanics plus the student-generated questions strategy is less effective than TGTS with only game mechanics in puzzle solving, it is in fact more effective in enhancing the algorithmic thinking skills. Additionally, this study demonstrated that TGTS with game mechanics plus the student-generated questions strategy can enhance students' engagement experiences and willingness to participate. This study can be a reference for designing learning activities and developing an online puzzle-based game learning system to promote students' learning of algorithmic thinking skills.;"[Hsu, Chih-Chao; Wang, Tzone-I.] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan";National Cheng Kung University;Wang, TI (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, 1 Daxue Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;"n98991077@mail.ncku.edu.tw; wti535@mail.ncku.edu.tw";;Hsu, Chih-Chao/0000-0001-9552-1949;;;;;103;62;68;9;183;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

We prove that our procedure synthesizes general witnesses in that if a witness is found, then for all inhabited input types, there exist values that can make the function go wrong. Second, we show how to extend this procedure to produce a reduction graph that can be used to interactively visualize and debug witness executions. Third, we evaluate the coverage of our approach on two data sets comprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs. Our technique is able to generate witnesses for around 85% of the programs, our reduction graph yields small counterexamples for over 80% of the witnesses, and a simple heuristic allows us to use witnesses to locate the source of type errors with around 70% accuracy. Finally, we evaluate whether our witnesses help students understand and fix type errors, and find that students presented with our witnesses show a greater understanding of type errors than those presented with a standard error message.;"[Seidel, Eric L.; Jhala, Ranjit] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Weimer, Westley] Univ Virginia, Dept Comp Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Virginia";Seidel, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.;"eseidel@cs.ucsd.edu; jhala@cs.ucsd.edu; weimer@virginia.edu";;;"NSF [CCF-1422471, CCF-1223850, CCF-1218344, CCF-1116289, CCF-0954024]; Air Force grant [FA8750-15-2-0075]";"NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Force grant(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory)";This work was supported by NSF grants CCF-1422471, CCF-1223850, CCF-1218344, CCF-1116289, CCF-0954024, Air Force grant FA8750-15-2-0075, and a gift from Microsoft Research.;;54;0;0;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;0956-7968;1469-7653;;J FUNCT PROGRAM;J.

In the smart city era, the increased attention to data harvested from the city fosters a more informed approach to city administration, requiring involved operators to drive, direct, and orient technological processes in the city more effectively. Such an increasing need requires tools and platforms that can easily and effectively be controlled by nontechnical people. In this paper, an approach for enabling easier composition of real-time data processing pipelines in smart cities is presented, exploiting a visual and block-based design approach, similar to the one adopted in the Scratch programming language for elementary school students. The proposed approach encompasses both a graphical editor and a sound methodology and workflow, to allow city operators to effectively design, develop, test, and deploy their own data processing pipelines. The editor and the workflow are described in the context of a pilot of the ALMANAC European project.;"[Bonino, Dario] Ist Super Mario Boella, Pervas Technol Res Area, I-10138 Turin, Italy; [De Russis, Luigi] Politecn Torino, Dept Control & Comp Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy";Polytechnic University of Turin;De Russis, L (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Control & Comp Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy.;"dario.bonino@ismb.it; luigi.derussis@polito.it";De Russis, Luigi/M-6728-2017;De Russis, Luigi/0000-0001-7647-6652;European Community [609081];European Community;This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under Grant 609081.;;27;5;5;1;13;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2327-4662;;;IEEE INTERNET THINGS;IEEE Internet Things J.;APR;2018;5;2;;;SI;;775;783;;10.1109/JIOT.2017.2728089;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2728089;;;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";GC7KD;;Green Published;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000429971100031;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using approaches from the spatial humanities, this article offers a case study for enhancing student learning through the creation of digital maps and itineraries in a campus-based course for subsequent use during a three-week program in Berlin. In particular, the concept of deep mapping is discussed as a means of augmenting understanding of the city and its history from a narrative across time to a narrative across the physical space of the city.

A prototype system was developed to test the proposed approach, and the system was evaluated using digital traces collected during actual cyber-investigations. The prototype system also links cases on the basis of exact similarity between technical characteristics. This work found that the introduction of near similarity helps to confirm already existing links, and exposes additional linkages between cases. Automatic detection of near similarities across cybercrimes gives digital investigators a better understanding of the criminal context and the actual phenomenon, and can reveal a series of related offenses. Using case data from 207 cyber-investigations, this study evaluated the effectiveness of computing similarity between cases by applying string similarity algorithms to email addresses. The Levenshtein algorithm was selected as the best algorithm to segregate similar email addresses from non-similar ones. This work can be extended to other digital traces common in cybercrimes such as URLs and domain names. In addition to finding linkages between related cybercrime at a technical level, similarities in patterns across cases provided insights at a behavioral level such as modus operandi (MO). This work also addresses the step that comes after the similarity computation, which is the linkage verification and the hypothesis formation. For forensic purposes, it is necessary to confirm that a near match with the similarity algorithm actually corresponds to a real relation between observed characteristics, and it is important to evaluate the likelihood that the disclosed similarity supports the hypothesis of the link between cases. This work recommends additional information, including certain technical, contextual and behavioral characteristics that could be collected routinely in cyber-investigations to support similarity computation and link evaluation.

First year experience abroad offers opportunities for students to explore a study abroad topic in depth at an early point in their academic career. Recently, significant numbers of faculty have begun to lead study abroad groups on the Camino de Santiago in Spain. Due to the increasing popularity of walking the Camino overall, overcrowding and other related issues are becoming a problem. I propose that faculty leading student groups on the Camino incorporate digital mapping tools as part of the curriculum to increase awareness among students about the potential impact they may have on local communities. Furthermore, the use of digital mapping tools to either complement or replace the more traditionally assigned journal will help the student meet the desired learning outcomes set forth by the first year experience abroad program-develop, experience and reflect.

In the context of the medium voltage (MV) grid, this has motivated the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), that offer high-precision synchronized grid monitoring, enabling mission-critical applications such as fault detection/location. However, PMU-based applications present stringent delay requirements, raising a significant challenge to the communication infrastructure. In contrast to the high voltage domain, there is no clear vision for the communication and network topologies for the MV grid; a full-fledged optical fiber-based communication infrastructure is a costly approach due to the density of PMUs required. In this study, we focus on the support of low-latency PMU-based applications in the MV domain, identifying and addressing the tradeoff between communication infrastructure deployment costs and the corresponding performance. We study a large set of real MV grid topologies to get an in-depth understanding of the various key latency factors. Building on the gained insights, we propose three algorithms for the careful placement of high capacity links, targeting a balance between deployment costs and achieved latencies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms result in low-latency network topologies while reducing deployment costs by up to 80% in comparison to a ubiquitous deployment of costly high capacity links.";"[Yang, Binxu; Katsaros, Konstantinos Vasileios; Chai, Wei Koong; Pavlou, George] UCL, London WC1E 6EA, England";"University of London; University College London";Yang, BX (corresponding author), UCL, London WC1E 6EA, England.;"binxu.yang@ucl.ac.uk; k.katsaros@ucl.ac.uk; w.chai@ucl.ac.uk; g.pavlou@ucl.ac.uk";Chai, Wei Koong/AAB-2408-2019;"Chai, Wei Koong/0000-0002-4847-5465; Katsaros, Konstantinos/0000-0001-8908-7867";"European Commission [318708]; CHIST-ERA/EPSRC UK project CONCERT [EP/L01835/1]";"European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); CHIST-ERA/EPSRC UK project CONCERT(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))";This work supported by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Program FP7-ICT-2011-8 under Grant 318708 (C-DAX) and the CHIST-ERA/EPSRC UK project CONCERT under the Grant EP/L01835/1.;;28;39;40;0;32;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1932-8184;1937-9234;;IEEE SYST J;IEEE Syst.

We applied a pairing approach in PSP education and managed to mitigate the size challenge without sacrificing education effectiveness, which has been verified in an experiment in 2010 (PSP2010). However, there are several issues (e.g., mutual interference among student pairs, confusing evaluation comments, untraceable corrections, etc.) existing in this experiment, which may create mist towards proper understanding of the education approach. Objective: In order to address the identified issues and better understand both pros and cons of the pairing approach, we replicated the experiment in 2014. Method: With new lab arrangement and evaluation mechanism devised, the replication (PSP2014) involved 120 students after their first academic year, who were separated into two groups with 40 pairs of students in one group and 40 solo students in the other. Results: Results of the replication include: 1) paired students conformed process discipline no worse (sometime better) than solo students; 2) paired students performed better than solo students in the final exam; 3) both groups spent comparable amount of time in preparing submissions; 4) both groups performed similar in size estimation and time estimation of the course assignments; 5) the quality of the programs developed by paired students is no less (sometime better) than solo students.

Traditional learning modalities based on didactic teaching and theoretical proofs alone are no longer sufficient for a holistic understanding of these algorithms. Instead, an environment that promotes an immersive, hands-on learning of distributed systems algorithms is needed to complement existing teaching modalities. Such an environment must be flexible to support the learning of a variety of algorithms. The environment should also support extensibility and reuse since many of these algorithms share several common traits with each other while differing only in some aspects. Finally, it must also allow students to experiment with large-scale deployments in a variety of operating environments. To address these concerns, we use the principles of software product lines and model-driven engineering, and adopt the cloud platform to design an immersive learning environment called the Playground of Algorithms for Distributed Systems (PADS). A prototype implementation of PADS is described to showcase use cases involving BitTorrent Peer-to-Peer file sharing, ZooKeeper-based coordination, and Paxos-based consensus, which show the benefits of rapid deployment of the distributed systems algorithms.

This paper analyzes the possibility of cooperation between neighboring independent microgids in a smart grid with renewable resources considering the security assets and vulnerabilities. The ultimate goal is to decrease the overall security risks on the smart grid. Modeling of microgrids cooperation is formulated via a coalition game definition considering the permissible amount of their vulnerabilities. Load shedding minimization can be obtained during cyber-attack occurrence for each member of coalition microgrids. This paper presents a comprehensive algorithm for optimal coalition of neighboring microgrids based on a utility function calculation which has three major components: Budget for Attack (BA), Budget for Defense (BD) and microgrid relationship effectiveness, to contribute more understanding, microgrid relationship effectiveness formulation is developed by the introduction of friction and influence matrices. Proportional Fairness (PF) index is employed to illustrate the improvement of utility function in case of optimal coalition in comparison with non-cooperative state. Microgrids coalition optimal choice based on suggested algorithm is validated by probability attack and loss of load probability (LOLP) simulation for each microgrid before and after the coalition form.;"[Fardad, Noorollah; Soleymani, Soodabeh; Faghihi, Faramarz] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran";Islamic Azad University;Soleymani, S (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran, Iran.;s.soleymani@srbiau.ac.ir;;;;;;;44;4;4;1;23;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1064-1246;1875-8967;;J INTELL FUZZY SYST;J.

J;Shrivastava, A;;;;Shrivastava, Archana;;;A small initiative in the journey of making leaders with the help of authentic leadership model;KYBERNETES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Authentic leadership; Values; Beliefs; Self awareness";"STUDENTS; SELF";"Purpose This research study uses authentic leadership (AL) model for leadership development. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the developmental perspective where the attention is on the processes. As the authenticity involves both owing one's personal experiences and acting in accordance with one's true self, the emphasis is on self-awareness and self-regulation. The influence of the person's personal history and trigger events are considered as significant antecedents for generating AL. As the research was facilitated by the participation and collaboration of the number of individuals with the researcher for common purpose, i.e. developing AL, action research methodology is adopted. Design/methodology/approach The methodology used was based on the self-assessment exercises in the controlled environment. The programme used intensive counselling sessions, Neuro Linguistics programming (NLP), career autobiographies, mind maps, workshops and storytelling sessions as tools. Certified counsellors and trainers were out-sourced for conducting such sessions. With the information generated through various sources, detailed career autobiographies of students' self-image were generated. These reports were then critically analysed on Nvivo, a software that supports qualitative and mixed research methods. Comprehensive data analysis was done to pull the information together and make sense of it. The development process model of AL began with how individuals interpret their accumulated life experiences with the Who I am? approach. NLP was used as a research instrument which involved question-based discussions, value elicitation exercise and Anchoring and Mentor table. The results that came after the exercises were reported by the students in a one-page autobiography. Findings The students learnt to live by their inner compass. They were finally able to relate themselves and their identity with their beliefs, thereby, understanding the term, Who Am I; the intentions closely related with the components of AL. Students realized that each one of them was unique. What lied beneath were exposed and the students were more at ease once they realized that they were able to balance these emotions and use them towards behaving congruently. The research concluded that doing such kind of exercises along with the main stream subjects is definitely going to help students emerge as a better person, employee and an authentic leader in the future. Practical implications The approach helped students become self-aware and self-confident and therefore enhanced their capacity to adapt positively to social set ups personally and professionally. The results suggest that such leadership development programmes along with the main stream subjects can foster AL giving students new abilities and embodied skills to deal with the practical challenges of life in a more effective manner. Originality/value This research study supports new emerging strategy of educating managers to become effective leaders and demonstrate that the development of AL can be fostered by such interventions during their journey of becoming leaders. Further, researches on whether AL can be developed through planned interventions can be certified through longitudinal studies in this area.";[Shrivastava, Archana] Birla Inst Management Technol, Dept Business Commun, Greater Noida, India;;Shrivastava, A (corresponding author), Birla Inst Management Technol, Dept Business Commun, Greater Noida, India.;archana.shrivastava@bimtech.ac.in;Shrivastava/M-2230-2017;Shrivastava/0000-0002-5877-9980;;;;;65;2;11;0;20;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0368-492X;1758-7883;;KYBERNETES;Kybernetes;;2018;47;10;;;;;1956;1972;;10.1108/K-01-2018-0003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-01-2018-0003;;;17;Computer Science, Cybernetics;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";Computer Science;GY6YL;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000448745300005;View Full Record in Web of Science

In fact, the 3-D medical models help ordinary people (including patients and students) to more easily understand and learn medical knowledge. In addition, with the rapid development of Web3D technology, the demand for 3-D visualization technology based on the web browser increases. However, the limited bandwidth and low load capacity of the browser have seriously restricted the development of technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework to better show 3-D skeleton shapes. In particular, mesh compression is one of the most effective methods to achieve a fast transmission data process. In addition, because of the poor rendering capabilities of the browsers, it is notably difficult to render the entire model at once. Moreover, it often makes the browser crash; thus, the transmitted model data are only rendered once. In addition, a mesh segmentation algorithm is proposed to realize component-wise rendering and lightweight for shape. A voxel-based component repetition method is used to detect the repetitive components; thus, we can perform matrix transformation to finish the repetitive-component Web3D visualization, i.e., lightweight for shape. Finally, the related experiments are performed to validate our proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework is feasible and superior.";"[Zhou, Wen; Jia, Jinyuan] Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Su, Xin] Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China";"Tongji University; Tongji University";Zhou, W (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.;zhouwen327@163.com;;ZHOU, WEN/0000-0002-1266-1864;"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [2100102002, 21002450051, 2100219066]; Key Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [0200219153]";"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Key Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China";This work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China, under Grant 2100102002, Grant 21002450051, and Grant 2100219066, and in part by the Key Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China, under Grant 0200219153.;;34;3;3;1;16;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2018;6;;;;;;47627;47635;;10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866508;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866508;;;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";GU6MD;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000445427300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

PLTL have been adopted for various science, engineering, technology and maths courses in several US universities. This paper proposed and evaluated a speech system for behavioral analysis of PLTL groups. It could help in identifying the best practices for PLTL. The CRSS-PLTL corpus was used for evaluation of developed algorithms. In this paper, we developed a robust speech activity detection (SAD) by fusing the outputs of a DNN-based pitch extractor and an unsupervised SAD based on voicing measures. Robust speaker diarization system consisted of bottleneck features (from stacked autoencoder) and informed HMM-based joint segmentation and clustering system. Behavioral characteristics such as participation, dominance, emphasis, curiosity and engagement were extracted by acoustic analyses of speech segments belonging to all students. We proposed a novel method for detecting question inflection and performed equal error rate analysis on PLTL corpus. In addition, a robust approach for detecting emphasized speech regions was also proposed. Further, we performed exploratory data analysis for understanding the distortion present in CRSS-PLTL corpus as it was collected in naturalistic scenario. The ground-truth Likert scale ratings were used for capturing the team dynamics in terms of student's responses to a variety of evaluation questions.

Multi-view learning is also known as data fusion or data integration from multiple feature sets. Since the last survey of multi-view machine learning in early 2013, multi-view learning has made great progress and developments in recent years, and is facing new challenges. This overview first reviews theoretical underpinnings to understand the properties and behaviors of multi-view learning. Then multi-view learning methods are described in terms of three classes to offer a neat categorization and organization. For each category, representative algorithms and newly proposed algorithms are presented. The main feature of this survey is that we provide comprehensive introduction for the recent developments of multi-view learning methods on the basis of coherence with early methods. We also attempt to identify promising venues and point out some specific challenges which can hopefully promote further research in this rapidly developing field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Software maintenance is an important activity in the development process where maintenance team members leave and new members join over time. The identification of files which are changed together frequently has been proposed several times. Yet existing studies about coupled file changes ignore the feedback from developers as well as the impact of these changes on the performance of maintenance and rather these studies rely on the analysis findings and expert evaluation. Methods. We investigate the usefulness of coupled file changes during perfective maintenance tasks when developers are inexperienced in programming or when they were new on the project. Using data milling on software repositories we identify files that are changed most frequently together in the past. We extract coupled file changes from the Git repository of a Java software system and join them with corresponding attributes from the versioning and issue tracking system and the project documentation. We present a controlled experiment involving 36 student participants in which we investigate if coupled file change suggestions influence the correctness of the task solutions and the required time to complete them. Results. The results show that the use of coupled file change suggestions significantly increases the correctness of the solutions. However, there is only a minor effect on the time required to complete the perfective maintenance tasks. We also derived a set of the most useful attributes based on the developers' feedback. Discussion. Coupled file changes and a limited number of the proposed attributes are usefull for inexperienced developers working on perfective maintenance tasks where although the developers using these suggestions solved more tasks, they still need time to understand and organize this information.;"[Ramadani, Jasmin; Wagner, Stefan] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Software Technol, Stuttgart, Germany";University of Stuttgart;Ramadani, J (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Software Technol, Stuttgart, Germany.;jasmin.ramadani@informatik.unistuttgart.de;Wagner, Stefan/A-5200-2018;"Wagner, Stefan/0000-0002-5256-8429; Ramadani, Jasmin/0000-0001-7180-9964";;;;;58;1;1;0;0;PEERJ INC;LONDON;341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND;;2376-5992;;PEERJ COMPUT SCI;PeerJ Comput.

In this article, we present a detailed analysis of the top Brazilian Computer Science graduate programs. The analysis involves profile data on faculty members (e.g., career length and number of mentored students) and on the quality of their research efforts, assessed using the quality of their publications and collaboration patterns. The objective is to uncover factors that explain the strengths and weaknesses of graduate programs. Results show that the highest ranked programs include more experienced faculty members, who have mentored more Ph.D. students. We also show that programs target distinct publication venues, with the best ranked ones focusing on higher quality conferences and journals. By analyzing collaboration patterns, we show that intra-program relationships occur quite naturally whereas inter-program ones are still very incipient.;"[Silva, Thiago H. P.; Laender, Alberto H.

Thus, the education of physiotherapists is a crucial concern in many countries. Information and communications technologies, such as motion capture systems, have been introduced to sophisticate the training methods used in physiotherapy. However, the methods employed in most training schools for physiotherapists and occupational therapists remain dependent on more conventional materials. These materials include conventional textbooks with samples of traditional gait motion photographs and video archives of patients' walking motion. Actual on-site clinical training is also utilized in current physiotherapy education programs. The present paper addresses an application of a previously developed digital human model called the kinematic digital human (KDH) to physiotherapy education with a focus on improving students' understanding of the gait motion of disabled patients. KDH models for use in physiotherapy were constructed based on Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center (RLANRC) terminology, which is considered the preferred standard among clinicians. The developed KDH models were employed to allow the three-dimensional visualization of the gait motion of a hemiplegic patient.;"[Kakizaki, Takao; Endo, Mai; Endo, Mitsuru] Nihon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Nakagawara 1, Koriyama, Fukushima 9638642, Japan; [Urii, Jiro] CAS Res, 44-4-105 Shimo, Tokyo 1970023, Japan";Nihon University;Kakizaki, T (corresponding author), Nihon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Nakagawara 1, Koriyama, Fukushima 9638642, Japan.;"kakizaki.takao@nihon-u.ac.jp; bluefascination@gmail.com; Jiro.URII@cas.fussa.tokyo.jp; m_endo@mech.ce.nihon-u.ac.jp";Endo, Mitsuru/ABA-6782-2020;Endo, Mitsuru/0000-0003-2019-6672;"JSPS KAKENHI [24510234]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24510234, 15K01233] Funding Source: KAKEN";"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";The authors would like to thank Mr. Yasuhiro Kudo and Ms. Emi Yokoyama, Special Needs Education School for the Visually Impaired, University of Tsukuba, for their advice on physiotherapy, including clinical kinematics education programs and the application example for the rehabilitation of a hemiplegic patient.

In particular, an effective sustainable development incorporates three fundamental pillars: environment, cost and society. While environment and cost have been already faced by numerous studies so far, society is still the less considered in manufacturing. Social sustainability comprises specific relapses on humans that are quantifiable through social assessment methods. This research work proposes a new Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) methodology, based on the United Nations Environment Programme and the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) framework, to support enterprise modelling and knowledge management to assess company sustainability by solving current issues and uncertainties regarding the evaluation of social impacts in the context of smart manufacturing. The analysis is settled into a LIFE + 2012 European Project, named LIFE GREEN SINKS. The project concerns the introduction of innovative materials for a new generation of kitchen sinks. The SLCA methodology proposed embeds a detailed inventory method tailored on real data, collected directly from the field of application thanks to customised surveys that allow modelling the enterprise and integrating data available from the manufacturing process. This method is designed as a supporting tool for enterprise modelling and strategic company decision-making. Specifically, it intends to help companies in understanding and, consequently reducing, social impacts of all processes related to a certain product from a life cycle perspective, to achieve an effective smart manufacturing for a sustainable development.

Professional developers of parallel software think in terms of parallel design patterns, which are markedly different from traditional (sequential) design patterns. It follows that the more we can teach students to think in terms of parallel patterns, the more their thinking will resemble that of parallel software professionals. In this paper, we present patternlets-minimalist, scalable, syntactically correct programs, each designed to introduce students to a particular parallel design pattern. The collection currently includes 44 patternlets (16 MPI, 17 OpenMP, 9 Pthreads, and 2 heterogeneous), of which we present a representative sample. We also present data that indicate the use of patternlets to introduce parallelism in CS2 produced a modest improvement in student understanding of parallel concepts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While there exist learning style questionnaires for identifying a student's learning style, such questionnaires have several disadvantages and therefore, research has been conducted on automatically identifying learning styles from students' behavior in a learning environment. Current approaches to automatically identify learning styles have an average precision between 66% and 77%, which shows the need for improvements in order to use such automatic approaches reliably in learning environments. In this paper, four computational intelligence algorithms (artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, ant colony system and particle swarm optimization) have been investigated with respect to their potential to improve the precision of automatic learning style identification. Each algorithm was evaluated with data from 75 students. The artificial neural network shows the most promising results with an average precision of 80.7%, followed by particle swarm optimization with an average precision of 79.1%. Improving the precision of automatic learning style identification allows more students to benefit from more accurate information about their learning styles as well as more accurate personalization towards accommodating their learning styles in a learning environment. Furthermore, teachers can have a better understanding of their students and be able to provide more appropriate interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected from 221 students enrolled in a general chemistry course at a Midwestern university. After learning the material in lecture, students completed two quizzes: Quiz 1 and Quiz 2. One quiz was delivered on paper and another quiz was taken on computer. Each quiz tested student understanding of different chemistry concepts and the quizzes were proctored on different days. Several days after Quiz 2, students took a practice test that tested the knowledge of Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 with different yet similar questions, and again, the testing mode of the practice test was either paper-and-pencil or computer. After each quiz and the practice test, students received feedback on their performance. Differences in performance between the quizzes and the practice test were measured with normalized gains and the differences between the normalized gains for each condition were analyzed using an Analysis of Variance. The results showed no significant testing mode effects among the four conditions overall, or for algorithmic, conceptual, or definition type of questions. Altogether, the results of the present study do not provide evidence to suggest that instructors need to be concerned about testing mode (paper versus computer) when designing and administering chemistry tests.

This problem considers multidimensional data with preestablished classes with the requirement of elements of different classes must be presented at distinctive regions. Such problem is commonly found on economic and social data, where visualization is important to understand a phenomenon before further analysis. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses a nonlinear transformation to preserve some data distance properties and display in a convenient format to interpretation. The proposed visualization algorithm is a partition-conforming projection, as defined by Kleinberg [An impossibility theorem for clustering, Adv. Neural Inform. Processing Syst. 15: Proc. 2002 Conf., 2003, The MIT Press, p. 463.], and completely separates the convex hull of data classes by applying locally linear operations. We applied this algorithm to visualize data from an important exam applied for over four million students of the Brazilian educational system Exame Nacional do Ensino Medio (ENEM). Results show that the proposed algorithm successfully separates unintelligible data and presents it more accessible to further visual analysis.;"[Albertini, Marcelo Keese; Backes, Andre Ricardo] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Sch Comp Sci, Av Joao Naves de Avila 2121, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil";Universidade Federal de Uberlandia;Albertini, MK (corresponding author), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Sch Comp Sci, Av Joao Naves de Avila 2121, BR-38408100 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.;"albertini@ufu.br; arbackes@yahoo.com.br";"Albertini, Marcelo K/J-7495-2012; Backes, André/JGD-9197-2023";"Backes, André/0000-0002-7486-4253; Albertini, Marcelo/0000-0002-1846-946X";"CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Brazil) [302416/2015-3]; FAPEMIG (Foundation to the Support of Research in Minas Gerais) [APQ-03437-15]; CNPq; FAPEMIG; PROPP-UFU [026/2013]";"CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG (Foundation to the Support of Research in Minas Gerais)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); PROPP-UFU";Prof. Andre R.

As one of the most important aspect of this technical-driven smart home system, learning and recognizing the occupant's routine activities and movement patterns is the foundation of further human behavior understanding and prediction process. In this paper, we propose a decomposition based unsupervised learning approach, which is able to learn the occupant's moving patterns directly from the sensor data without event annotations. It overcomes the limitation suffered by a lot of other supervised learning approaches that sensor data sets with event annotations are not difficult to collect since manually data labeling is not scalable and extremely time consuming. By applying the proposed method on Aruba motion sensor data set, we show that the decomposition based pattern learning method leverages the well-developed Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm that it can learn the movement pattern candidates of the occupant very fast, with outputs that can be easily interpreted.;"[Zhang, Tongda] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fu, Wensi] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Petr & Geosyst Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Ye, Jinchao] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Fischer, Martin] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";"Stanford University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Stanford University; Stanford University";Zhang, TD (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;"tdzhang@stanford.edu; wensi_fu@utexas.edu; jinchaoye07@gmail.com; fischer@stanford.edu";Zhang, Tongda/Q-2343-2018;Fischer, Martin/0000-0002-5071-017X;;;;;27;17;18;0;9;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1868-5137;1868-5145;;J AMB INTEL HUM COMP;J.

Exploration of MOOC forum data can offer valuable insights for these staff to enhance the course and prepare the next release. However, it is challenging due to the large, complicated, and heterogeneous nature of relevant datasets, which contain multiple dynamically interacting objects such as users, posts, and threads, each one including multiple attributes. In this paper, we present a design study for developing an interactive visual analytics system, called iForum, that allows for effectively discovering and understanding temporal patterns in MOOC forums. The design study was conducted with three domain experts in an iterative manner over one year, including a MOOC instructor and two official teaching assistants. iForum offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the three interleaving aspects of MOOC forums (i. e., posts, users, and threads) at three different scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of iForum, we describe a case study involving field experts, in which they use iForum to investigate real MOOC forum data for a course on JAVA programming.;"[Fu, Siwei; Qu, Huamin] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jian] Autodesk Res, Paris, France; [Cui, Weiwei] Microsoft Res, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Autodesk, Inc.; Microsoft";Fu, SW (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;"sfuaa@ust.hk; jian.zhao@autodesk.com; Weiwei.Cui@microsoft.com; huamin@ust.hk";ZHU, JIALI/JNE-3065-2023;;"RGC [618313]; ITF [ITS/306/15FP]";"RGC(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); ITF";We thank all the domain experts, i.e., Ting-Chuen Pong, Tony W K Fung and Amy Quon, involved in the studies.

By doing so, a picture will be given of the international expansion of the iSchool concept in terms of organisational symbolism and practical educational content. In order to underline the approaches of the Scandinavian schools, comparisons are made to three American iSchools. Design/methodology/approach-The study is framed through theory on organisational symbolism and the intentions of the iSchool movement as formulated in its vision statements. Empirically, the study consists of two parts: close readings of three documents outlining the considerations of three Scandinavian LIS schools before applying for the iSchool status, and statistical analysis of 427 syllabi from master level courses at three Scandinavian and three American iSchools. Findings-All three Scandinavian schools, analysed, have recently become iSchools, and though some differences are visible, it is hard to distinguish anything in their syllabi as carriers of what can be described as an iSchool identity. In considering iSchool identity, it instead benefits on a symbolic level that are most prominent, such as branding, social visibility and the possible attraction of new student groups. The traditionally strong relation to national library sectors are emphasised as important to maintain, specifically in Norway and Sweden. Research limitations/implications-The study is done on iSchools in Denmark, Norway and Sweden with empirical comparison to three American schools. These comparisons face the challenge of meeting the educational system and programme structure of each individual country. Despite this, findings prove possible to use as ground for conclusions, although empirical generalisations concerning, for instance, other countries must be made with caution. Practical implications-This study highlights the practical challenges met in international expansion of the iSchool movement, both on a practical and symbolic level. Both the iSchool Caucus and individual schools considering becoming iSchools may use these findings as a point of reference in development and decision making. Originality/value-This is an original piece of research from which the results may contribute to the international development of the iSchool movement, and extend the theoretical understanding of the iSchool movement as an educational and organisational construct.;"[Golub, Koraljka; Hansson, Joacim; Selden, Lars] Linnaeus Univ, Sch Cultural Sci, Vaxjo, Sweden";Linnaeus University;Golub, K (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Sch Cultural Sci, Vaxjo, Sweden.;koraljka.golub@lnu.se;;;;;;;23;4;4;1;48;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0022-0418;1758-7379;;J DOC;J.

The way information is framed by the media has been found to influence the behavior of news recipients. The purpose of this paper is to hypothesize that the exposure to TV media frames would affect a lay audience's online information-seeking behavior. Design/methodology/approach - In an experiment combining eye tracking and content analysis, participants (n = 72) were exposed to one of three TV clips with different media frames (based on a full-sample content analysis) that focused on Alzheimer's disease. After exposure, participants informed themselves about the issue online. Eye tracking allows to investigate whether individuals mainly scan information, or whether they compute information on a higher level of attention (use more thorough deliberate comparison of information and really reading information). Findings - Three different frames of online content were identified. Framing was found to influence the individual online searching and reading of information on a descriptive level (entering search words and viewing website content) to some degree, but not on a procedural level (such as selecting online search results). Research limitations/implications - This study makes a significant contribution to the literature embedding an established theoretical process like framing effects into the internet literature. Regarding the broader theoretical context, this study shed some light on cross-media framing effects on online behavior. Applying the psychological perspective of framing theory to explain and predict online searching behavior is beneficial for specific types of online search behavior. Main limitations are the not representative student sample and the forced task that participants had to inform themselves about Alzheimer's disease online. Practical implications - The results have practical implications for the creation of TV-related websites. There can be a positive, profitable synergy of TV and online websites. The websites can complement the TV programs with the focus on information needs of the recipients depending on the TV activated audience frames. Therefore, media managers would do well to plan the contents of their websites as internet-based resources that meet the activated information needs. Originality/value - This study is among the first to investigate the framing effects of TV on the online information searching behavior of individuals. A deeper understanding of how media frames, especially from TV, are affecting online information seeking will allow researchers to better explain and predict online user behavior and information needs. But still, more research is needed.;"[Kessler, Sabrina Heike] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Commun Res, Jena, Germany; [Guenther, Lars] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Res Evaluat Sci & Technol, Stellenbosch, South Africa";"Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Stellenbosch University";Kessler, SH (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Commun Res, Jena, Germany.;sabrina.kessler@uni-jena.de;"Kessler, Sabrina/ITV-7385-2023; Kessler, Sabrina/T-5573-2018";"Kessler, Sabrina/0000-0003-1858-7041; Kessler, Sabrina/0000-0003-1858-7041; Guenther, Lars/0000-0001-7760-0416";;;;;54;17;17;1;44;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1066-2243;;;INTERNET RES;Internet Res.;;2017;27;2;;;;;303;320;;10.1108/IntR-01-2016-0015;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IntR-01-2016-0015;;;18;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)";"Business & Economics; Computer Science; Telecommunications";EQ4SB;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000398067400008;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronymfor the Spanish name Panel de Analiticas de Aprendizaje deDislexia en Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learnermodel. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help themto increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help themto understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, aswell as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process.

While significant research has been conducted examining macro-level strategies (e.g., promoting MIS activities), very few studies have examined micro-level strategies (e.g., promoting Structured Query Language). The purpose of this study is to empirically examine both curriculum-oriented and promotional interventions by introducing SQL into foundation information systems curricula. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), 180 students completed a survey to measure attitude, behavior norms, and plans to enroll in a database class in the future. Additionally, both the hands-on SQL instruction and the promotional SQL intervention played a moderating role on the impact attitude had on plans to take a database course. These results add to our pedagogical understanding of enrollment decisions as well as provide practical solutions educators may use to keep pace with enrollment demands.;"[Mills, Robert J.; Beaulieu, Tanya Y.; Johnson, Jeffrey J.] Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA";"Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University";Mills, RJ (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Management Informat Syst, 3515 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.;bob.mills@usu.edu;;Beaulieu, Tanya/0000-0001-8467-9441;;;;;49;0;0;0;9;TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC;PHILADELPHIA;530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA;0887-4417;2380-2057;;J COMPUT INFORM SYST;J.

Similarly, learning analytics research proposes the combination of detailed data traces derived from technology-mediated tasks with a variety of algorithms to predict student academic performance. The former approach is designed to provide meaningful pedagogical guidance, while the latter is designed to identify event patterns and relations that can be translated into actionable remediation. The benefits of both approaches have motivated this study to investigate if a combination of the self-report data and data arising from an observation of the engagement of students with online learning events offers a deeper understanding and explanation of why some students achieve relatively higher levels of academic performance. In this paper we explore how to combine data about self-regulated learning skills with observable measures of online activity in a blended learning course to increase predictive capabilities of student academic performance for the purposes of informing teaching and task design. A case study in a course with 145 students showed that the variation of the students' final score for their course is better explained when factors from both approaches are considered. The results point to the potential of adopting a combined use of self-report and observed data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of successful university student learning.;"[Pardo, Abelardo] Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Han, Feifei; Ellis, Robert A.] Univ Sydney, Inst Teaching & Learning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia";"University of Sydney; University of Sydney";Pardo, A (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;"Abelardo.pardo@sydney.edu.au; Feifei.han@sydney.edu.au; Robert.ellis@sydney.edu.au";"Pardo, Abelardo/C-3001-2011; Han, Feifei/S-9552-2019";"Pardo, Abelardo/0000-0002-6857-0582; Han, Feifei/0000-0001-8464-0854";;;;;59;118;118;7;171;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

With all that is known regarding the benefits of programming, little is the published evidence showing how high school students can learn basic programming concepts following innovative instructional formats correctly with the respect to gain/enhance their computational thinking skills. This distinction has caused lack of their motivation and interest in Computer Science courses. This case study presents the opinions of twenty-eight (n=28) high school students who participated voluntarily in a 3D-game-like environment created in Second Life. This environment was combined with the 2D programming environment of Scratch4SL for the implementation of programming concepts (i.e. sequence and concurrent programming commands) in a blended instructional format. An instructional framework based on Papert's theory of Constructionism to assist students how to coordinate or manage better the learning material in collaborative practice-based learning activities is also proposed. By conducting a mixed-method research, before and after finishing several learning tasks, students' participation in focus group (qualitative data) and their motivation based on their experiences (quantitative data) are measured. Findings indicated that an instructional design framework based on Constructionism for acquiring or empowering students' social, cognitive, higher order and computational thinking skills is meaningful.

Furthermore, by implementing the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle [ASQ] in each development, students had the opportunity to identify and solve problems during the semester. Using this framework, we worked on the following three educational problems in Japan: (1) Mixed development with students of diverse ages and educational levels (2) Consciousness of development time (3) Understanding of each individual's strong and weak points Finally, we compared three types of programs (this program, Global Game Jam, and a mentor-based development program) in order to evaluate the aspects of game development that can be learned by them.

The operation of routing protocols is difficult to understand and some problems may occur while developing these protocols. Simulation is a relatively fast way of estimating these protocols and understating what is happening in the network. Thus, this paper presents an open source Graphical based educational simulation tool called Gbest-WSN for simulating routing protocols of the static and mobile, homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs. Gbest-WSN tool has a user-friendly interface that helps the user to select the routing protocol and define the network configuration. It is provided with four routing protocols; namely LEACH, LEACH-Mobile, immune algorithm-based and genetic algorithm-based routing protocols. Also, it allows the user to update the existing routing protocols and add a new routing protocol. Gbest-WSN is provided with radio, coverage and mobility models for modeling the hardware of the sensor node. It shows a detailed 2D and 3D graphical perception for what is happing during the routing process. Also, it has the ability to compare the simulation results of different simulation methods or different network configurations. In addition, it allows the user to save and load simulation scenarios and also exports the graphical results on PDF files and the statistical results on excel or mat files. Moreover, Gbest-WSN is provided with html help documents to help the user how to use it. The illustrative simulation examples clarified that the Gbest-WSN is a helpful tool for the students, teachers and researchers who work in the field of WSNs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

RI algorithms such as PRISM usually produce If-Then classifiers, which have a comparable predictive performance to other traditional classification approaches such as decision trees and associative classification. Hence, these classifiers are favourable for carrying out decisions by users and therefore they can be utilised as decision making tools. Nevertheless, RI methods, including PRISM and its successors, suffer from a number of drawbacks primarily the large number of rules derived. This can be a burden especially when the input data is largely dimensional. Therefore, pruning unnecessary rules becomes essential for the success of this type of classifiers. This article proposes a new RI algorithm that reduces the search space for candidate rules by early pruning any irrelevant items during the process of building the classifier. Whenever a rule is generated, our algorithm updates the candidate items frequency to reflect the discarded data examples associated with the rules derived. This makes items frequency dynamic rather static and ensures that irrelevant rules are deleted in preliminary stages when they don't hold enough data representation. The major benefit will be a concise set of decision making rules that are easy to understand and controlled by the decision maker. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment and hence it can now be utilised by different types of users such as managers, researchers, students and others. Experimental results using real data from the security domain as well as sixteen classification datasets from University of California Irvine (UCI) repository reveal that the proposed algorithm is competitive in regards to classification accuracy when compared to known RI algorithms. Moreover, the classifiers produced by our algorithm are smaller in size which increase their possible use in practical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in the levels and concentrations of computer science knowledge versus computer skills in the curricula are investigated. Similarities and differences between architecture and engineering (including construction management) programs are studied through comparing the data associated with these disciplines. The survey results are presented as useful benchmarks for decision-making regarding research, industry collaboration, and understanding the speed and needs for change in AEC curricula. Key findings of the study include (1)the importance of most computing skills and the coverage of curricula for these skills have not changed significantly over these 2years, while the competence of the students in these skills have decreased; (2)increasing trends have been seen in the percentages of computer science knowledge related courses in all program types and levels; (3)the percentage of computing skills related courses are more than the percentages of the computer science knowledge related courses in AEC curricula; (4)an increasing trend has been seen in the importance of the knowledge of scientific concepts of computing in respondents' perceptions; and (5)computing education still is not sufficient to meet the demands of the AEC industry.";"[Khashe, Saba] Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Sonny Astani Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3620 S Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Gerber, David J.] Univ Southern Calif, Sch Architecture, Watt Hall 316, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Gerber, David J.] Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Sonny Astani Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Watt Hall 316, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Smith, Ian F.

CBM programs in industrial systems can become extremely complex, especially when considering the effective introduction of new capabilities provided by PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) and E-maintenance disciplines. In this scenario, any CBM solution involves the management of numerous technical aspects, that the maintenance manager needs to understand, in order to be implemented properly and effectively, according to the company's strategy. This paper provides a comprehensive representation of the key components of a generic CBM solution, this is presented using a framework or supporting structure for an effective management of the. CBM programs. The concept symptom of failure, its corresponding analysis techniques (introduced by ISO 13379-1 and linked with RCM/FMEA analysis), and other international standard for CBM open-software application development (for instance, ISO 13374 and OSA-CBM), are used in the paper for the development of the framework. An original template has been developed, adopting the formal structure of RCM analysis templates, to integrate the information of the PHM techniques used to capture the failure mode behaviour and to manage maintenance. Finally, a case study describes the framework using the referred template. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;"[Guillen, Antonio J.; Crespo, Adolfo; Fco.

In this study, a driver assistance system with a dual control scheme is developed; it attempts to perform simultaneously the safety control of the vehicle and identification of the driver's state. The assistance system implements partial control in the event of lane departure and gives the driver the chance to voluntarily take the action needed. If the driver fails to implement the steering action needed within a limited time, the assistance system judges that the driver's understanding of the given situation is incorrect and executes the remaining control. We used a driving simulator equipped with the assistance system to investigate the effectiveness of identifying driver drowsiness and preventing lane departure accidents. Twenty students participated in three trials on a straight expressway, and they were required to implement only lateral control. We hypothesized that a participant cannot implement the action needed to maintain safety when he/she falls asleep, and that in such a case, the assistance system will implement the safety control repeatedly.

Mathematical calculations are complex and are covered only in advanced courses. Main problem in the first degree courses is the understanding of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Monte Carlo method is based on probabilistic concepts and its application to quantum calculations can be carried out quite straightforward. In this work, a simple Monte Carlo method was used to obtain a sequence of random electron coordinates according to the probability given by the wave function. Electron is seen as a shot whose appearance is only accepted and plotted when probability is high enough. Hydrogen atom was studied as it is a familiar system for most students and its description can be easily related to previous knowledge of atomic orbitals. The objective of the present work is to supply all the crucial points that students need to create their own program to plot atomic orbitals according to the above ideas. All the numerical details are indicated in order to get the proposed programming project as a simple task. Student should be able to generate random electron coordinates, to compute wave functions and probabilities, and to obtain plots according to the right probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. In order to show the quantitative obtained plots some results were shown. Typical s, p, and d orbitals were obtained and compared to the usual angular and radial representation.

We present a dynamic approach to explaining type errors by generating counterexample witness inputs that illustrate how an ill-typed program goes wrong. First, given an ill-typed function, we symbolically execute the body to synthesize witness values that make the program go wrong. We prove that our procedure synthesizes general witnesses in that if a witness is found, then for all inhabited input types, there exist values that can make the function go wrong. Second, we show how to extend the above procedure to produce a reduction graph that can be used to interactively visualize and debug witness executions. Third, we evaluate the coverage of our approach on two data sets comprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs. Our technique is able to generate witnesses for 88% of the programs, and our reduction graph yields small counterexamples for 81% of the witnesses. Finally, we evaluate whether our witnesses help students understand and fix type errors, and find that students presented with our witnesses show a greater understanding of type errors than those presented with a standard error message.;"[Seidel, Eric L.; Jhala, Ranjit] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weimer, Westley] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA";"University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Virginia";Seidel, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.;"eseidel@cs.ucsd.edu; jhala@cs.ucsd.edu; weimer@viginia.edu";;;"NSF [CCF-1422471, CCF-1223850, CCF-1218344, CCF-1116289, CCF-0954024]; Air Force grant [FA8750-15-2-0075]";"NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Force grant(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory)";This work was supported by NSF grants CCF-1422471, CCF-1223850, CCF-1218344, CCF-1116289, CCF-0954024, Air Force grant FA8750-15-2-0075, and a generous gift from Microsoft Research.;;42;14;17;1;2;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;0362-1340;1558-1160;;ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES;ACM Sigplan Not.;SEP;2016;51;9;;;;;228;242;;10.1145/3022670.2951915;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3022670.2951915;;;15;Computer Science, Software Engineering;"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)";Computer Science;EJ9XN;;Green Submitted, Bronze;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000393580700021;View Full Record in Web of Science

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthcare organizations are integratingmore health information technologies and relying on the electronic health record for data collection, communication, and decision making. Nursing faculty need to prepare graduates for this environment and incorporate an academic electronic health record into a nursing curriculum to meet student-program outcomes. Although the need exists for student preparation, some nursing programs are struggling with implementation, whereas others have been successful. To better understand these complexities, this project was intended to identify current challenges and success strategies of effective academic electronic health record integration into nursing curricula. Using Rogers' 1962 Diffusion of Innovation theory as a framework for technology adoption, a descriptive survey design was used to gain insights from deans and program directors of nursing schools involved with the national Health Informatics & Technology Scholars faculty development program or Cerner's Academic Education Solution Consortium, working to integrate an academic electronic health record in their respective nursing schools. The participants' experiences highlighted approaches used by these schools to integrate these technologies. Data from this project provide nursing education with effective strategies and potential challenges that should be addressed for successful academic electronic health record integration.;"[Herbert, Valerie M.] Husson Univ, Sch Nursing, 1 Coll Circle,Room 238, Bangor, ME 04401 USA; [Connors, Helen] Univ Kansas, Sch Nursing, Integrat Technol, Kansas City, KS USA";"Husson University; University of Kansas";Herbert, VM (corresponding author), Husson Univ, Sch Nursing, 1 Coll Circle,Room 238, Bangor, ME 04401 USA.;Valerie.Herbert@maine.edu;CERVANTES, EMILY/R-6274-2018;;;;;;43;18;26;3;33;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1538-2931;1538-9774;;CIN-COMPUT INFORM NU;CIN-Comput.

The high cost of laboratory equipment deprives many educational institutions of delivering quality education. Virtual laboratories can alleviate this problem substantially. Virtual laboratories with audiovisual and force feedback make the understanding and analysis of many engineering courses possible. This paper presents the design and implementation of an interactive virtual control laboratory (IVCL) for university students studying engineering at the undergraduate level. In this laboratory, six experimental setups are designed and for each setup, five to six scenarios are considered. Therefore, a considerable amount of the classical concepts in control course and a selection of advanced concepts such as impedance control and fuzzy control are covered. Statistical analysis for both experimental and control groups' pre-test and post-test indicates the effectiveness of this interactive virtual laboratory. For example, the mean scores for the experimental group was 21% higher in comparison with the control group and 18% higher in comparison with their own pre-test. Also, according to students' responses to survey questions, a laboratory program is necessary for the control course and interactive virtual laboratory can compensate lack of a real laboratory.

More than half of early childhood educators in the U.S. now have access to tablets, making it imperative to understand how they are using the device and what influences such use. The current study draws on survey data from 411 preschool educators serving 3 to 5-year-olds in school-based, center-based, and Head Start preschool programs to investigate how TPACK contextual factors (e.g., student background, teacher attitudes, and school support) influence teachers' traditional and student-centered tablet computer practices. Results suggest that teacher-level factors especially positive attitudes toward technology are most influential. Overall, this study emphasizes the need for preschool teachers and teacher educators to understand and address the critical contextual factors of tablet computer use in preschool education. Implications for education policy include expanding traditional funding models beyond technology access to provide on-going educator support, and developing new initiatives that encourage novel professional development models based on the same learned-centered practices that teachers are encouraged to use themselves.

Usually, Machine Learning is exploited as a tool for analyzing data coming from experimental studies, but it has been recently applied to humans as if they were algorithms that learn from data. One example is the application of Rademacher Complexity, which measures the capacity of a learning machine, to human learning, which led to the formulation of Human Rademacher Complexity (HRC). In this line of research, we propose here a more powerful measure of complexity, the Human Algorithmic Stability (HAS), as a tool to better understand the learning process of humans. The experimental results from three different empirical studies, on more than 600 engineering students from the University of Genoa, showed that HAS (i) can be measured without the assumptions required by HRC, (ii) depends not only on the knowledge domain, as HRC, but also on the complexity of the problem, and (iii) can be exploited for better understanding of the human learning process.

We propose and discuss a simple readability measure for software, SRES, and apply it to object-oriented textbook examples. Our results show that readability measures correlate well with human perceptions of quality. Compared with other readability measures, SRES is less sensitive to commenting and whitespace.

To understand the state of the art, we provide a comparative analysis of existing algorithms. The analysis is based on eight criteria that help to characterize the systems, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. We also propose a taxonomy that classifies algorithms based on their approach.

However, the empirical evidence of the impact of programmes that adopt ICT in schooling is mixed. Theory suggests it may be due to differences in whether or not the ICT programmes are integrated into a teaching programme of a class. Unfortunately, few empirical studies compare the relative effectiveness of programmes that integrate ICT into teaching with the ones that do not. In order to understand the most effective way to design new programmes that attempt to utilize ICT to improve English learning, we conducted a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) with some schools receiving ICT that was integrated into the teaching programme of the class; with some schools that received ICT without having it integrated into the teaching programme; and with other schools being used as controls. The RCT involved 6304 fifth grade students studying English in 127 rural schools in rural China. Our results indicate that when the programme is integrated into the teaching programme of a class it is effective in improving student test scores relative to the control schools. No programme impact, however, is found when the ICT programme is not integrated into the teaching program. We also find that when ICT programmes are integrated into teaching, the programmes work similarly for students that have either high or low initial (or baseline) levels of English competency. When ICT programmes are not integrated with teaching, they only raise the educational performance of English students who were performing better during the baseline. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The two typical study areas of theoretical research on signal/data processing are of modeling (i.e., understanding of signal's behavior) and of analysis (i.e., evaluation of given signal for finding its association to existing signal models). The objective of this paper is to provide a stochastic framework to design both fuzzy filtering and analysis algorithms in a unified manner. The signals are modeled via linear-in-parameters models (e.g., a type of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model) based on variational Bayes (VB) methodology. This gives rise to the negative free energy maximizing filtering algorithm. The issue of intractability was handled first by carefully choosing the priors as conjugate to the likelihood and then by using Stirling approximation for the Gamma function. This paper highlighted that it was analytically possible to maximize the information theoretic quantity, mutual information, exactly in the same manner as maximizing negative free energy in VB methodology. This gives rise to the  variational information maximizing analysis algorithm. The robustness of the methodology against data outliers is achieved by modeling the noises with Student-t distributions. The framework takes into account the inputs noises as well apart from the usually considered output noise. The robustness of the adaptive filtering algorithm against noise is shown by a deterministic analysis where an upper bound on the magnitude of estimation errors is derived.;"[Kumar, Mohit] Univ Rostock, Ctr Life Sci Automat, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Stoll, Norbert; Thurow, Kerstin] Univ Rostock, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Inst Automat, D-18119 Rostock, Germany; [Stoll, Regina] Univ Rostock, Fac Med, Inst Prevent Med, D-18055 Rostock, Germany";"University of Rostock; University of Rostock; University of Rostock";Kumar, M (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Ctr Life Sci Automat, D-18119 Rostock, Germany.;mohit.kumar@uni-rostock.de;Thurow, Kerstin/AAY-4709-2020;"Stoll, Regina/0000-0003-2800-5252; , Mohit/0000-0002-7368-5157";;;;;47;12;12;0;8;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2168-2267;2168-2275;;IEEE T CYBERNETICS;IEEE T.

Traditionally, EDM has addressed the following problems: clustering, classification, regression, anomaly detection and association rule mining. In this paper, the ordinal regression (OR) paradigm, is introduced in the field of EDM. The goal of OR problems is the classification of items in an ordinal scale. For instance, the prediction of students' performance in categories (where the different grades could be ordered according to A > B > C > D) is a classical example of an OR problem. The EDM community has not yet explored this paradigm (despite the importance of these problems in the field of EDM). Furthermore, an amenable and interpretable OR model based on the concept of gravitation is proposed. The model is an extension of a recently proposed gravitational model that tackles imbalanced nominal classification problems. The model is carefully adapted to the ordinal scenario and validated with four EDM datasets. The results obtained were compared with state-of-the-art OR algorithms and nominal classification ones. The proposed models can be used to better understand the learning-teaching process in higher education environments.;"[Gomez-Rey, Pilar; Barbera, Elena] Open Univ Catalunya, eLearn Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Fernandez-Navarro, Francisco] Univ Loyola Andalucia, Dept Math & Engn, Andalucia, Spain";"UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; Universidad Loyola Andalucia";Gómez-Rey, P (corresponding author), Open Univ Catalunya, eLearn Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.;pgomez_del_rey@uoc.edu;;"Fernandez-Navarro, Francisco/0000-0002-5599-6170; Gomez-Rey, Pilar/0000-0002-1883-4279";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [TIN2014-54583-C2-1-R]; FEDER funds; project of the Junta de Andalucia (Spain) [P2011- TIC-7508]";"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)(Spanish Government); FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); project of the Junta de Andalucia (Spain)(Junta de Andalucia)";The research work of F.

The system can evaluate and identify learning needs for clinical competency and be used as a learning tool to increase clinical competency by using computers. The system includes 10 high-risk, high-volume clinical case scenarios coupled with questions testing clinical reasoning, interpersonal, and technical skills. Questions were sequenced to reflect patients' changing condition and arranged by following the process of collecting and managing information, diagnosing and differentiating urgency of problems, and solving problems. The content validity and known-groups validity was established. The Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 was 0.90 and test-retest reliability was supported (r = 0.78). Nursing educators can use the system to understand students' needs for achieving clinical competence, and therefore, educational plans can be made to better prepare students and facilitate their smooth transition to a future clinical environment. Clinical nurses can use the system to evaluate their performance-based abilities and weakness in clinical reasoning.

J;Davis, E;;;;Davis, Ernest;;;How to Write Science Questions That Are Easy for People and Hard for Computers;AI MAGAZINE;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;As a challenge problem for AI systems, I propose the use of hand-constructed multiple-choice tests, with problems that are easy for people but hard for computers. Specifically, I discuss techniques for constructing such problems at the level of a fourth-grade child and at the level of a high school student. For the fourth-grade-level questions, I argue that questions that require the understanding of time, of impossible or pointless scenarios, of causality, of the human body, or of sets of objects, and questions that require combining facts or require simple inductive arguments of indeterminate length can be chosen to be easy for people, and are likely to be hard for AI programs, in the current state of the art. For the high school level, I argue that questions that relate the formal science to the realia of laboratory experiments or of real-world observations are likely to be easy for people and hard for AI programs. I argue that these are more useful benchmarks than existing standardized tests such as the SATs or New York Regents tests. Since the questions in standardized tests are designed to be hard for people, they often leave many aspects of what is hard for computers but easy for people untested.;[Davis, Ernest] NYU, Comp Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA;New York University;Davis, E (corresponding author), NYU, Comp Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.;;;;;;;;22;8;9;1;4;AMER ASSOC ARTIFICIAL INTELL;MENLO PK;445 BURGESS DRIVE, MENLO PK, CA 94025-3496 USA;0738-4602;;;AI MAG;AI Mag.;SPR;2016;37;1;;;;;13;22;;10.1609/aimag.v37i1.2637;http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aimag.v37i1.2637;;;10;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;DH7BW;;Bronze;;;2024-08-19;WOS:000372947200003;View Full Record in Web of Science

The programs range from simple simulators to specific teaching tools to advanced and specialized software. We assessed several simulators and selected one that was freely available and that enabled the students to learn the concepts to the fullest.

J;Agaoglu, M;;;;Agaoglu, Mustafa;;;Predicting Instructor Performance Using Data Mining Techniques in Higher Education;IEEE ACCESS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Artificial neural networks; classification algorithms; decision trees; linear discriminant analysis; performance evaluation; support vector machines";STUDENT-EVALUATIONS;Data mining applications are becoming a more common tool in understanding and solving educational and administrative problems in higher education. In general, research in educational mining focuses on modeling student's performance instead of instructors' performance. One of the common tools to evaluate instructors' performance is the course evaluation questionnaire to evaluate based on students' perception. In this paper, four different classification techniques decision tree algorithms, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and discriminant analysis are used to build classifier models. Their performances are compared over a data set composed of responses of students to a real course evaluation questionnaire using accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity performance metrics. Although all the classifier models show comparably high classification performances, C5.0 classifier is the best with respect to accuracy, precision, and specificity. In addition, an analysis of the variable importance for each classifier model is done. Accordingly, it is shown that many of the questions in the course evaluation questionnaire appear to be irrelevant.

Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency, and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks' problems. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency. As understanding the current status of 5G implementation is important for its eventual commercialization, we also discuss relevant field trials, drive tests, and simulation experiments. Finally, we point out major existing research issues and identify possible future research directions.;"[Agiwal, Mamta; Saxena, Navrati] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Suwon 440746, South Korea; [Roy, Abhishek] Samsung Elect, Network Div, Adv Technol Grp, Suwon 440746, South Korea";"Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Samsung; Samsung Electronics";Agiwal, M (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Suwon 440746, South Korea.;"mamta@skku.edu; abhishek.roy@samsung.com; navrati@skku.edu";"Saxena, Navrati/AAY-2493-2021; Agiwal, Mamta/HZK-3159-2023";"Saxena, Navrati/0000-0002-4875-0420; Agiwal, Mamta/0000-0002-6703-1165";Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [S-2015-0849-000];Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education;This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (S-2015-0849-000).;;228;1995;2171;33;963;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;;1553-877X;;IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT;IEEE Commun.

In such complex urban systems, it is impossible to established teaching centers of night school in every district of city for continuing education programs. Part-time students tend to be educated in popular locations of city due to convenience. Since call logs and geographical nature of mobile phone data can provide an opportunity to measure human behavior and social dynamics, we investigate how to infer urban popular locations with large-scale quasi-social network for avoiding the limitation of data collection and even privacy problems. A large-scale quasi-social network model is developed via measuring the number of shared-user between zones, which is different from previous models for social network. We first verify whether or not this model also can show the social structure of given data, the ranking of places in the model have been calculated based on eigvalue metric.

Any e-Learning system could be much more improved by tracking students commitment and disengagement on that course, in turn, would allow system to have personalized involvements at appropriate times in order to re-engage learners. Motivations play a important role to get back the learners on the track could be done by analyzing of several attributes of the log files. This paper aims to analyze the multiple attributes which cause the learners to disengage from an online learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - For this improvisation, Web based learning system is researched using data mining techniques in education. There are various attributes characterized for the disengagement prediction using web log file analysis. Though, there have been several attempts to include motivating characteristics in e-Learning systems are adapted, presently influence on cognition is acknowledged mostly. Findings - Classification is one of the predictive data mining technique which makes prediction about values of data using known results found from different data sets. To find out the optimal solution for identifying disengaged learners in the online learning systems, Naive Bayesian (NB) classifier with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used which will classify the data set and then perform the independent analysis. Originality/value - The experimental results shows that the use of unrelated variables in the class attributes will reduce the accuracy and reliability of a any classification model. However, the hybrid PSO algorithm is clearly more apt to find minor subsets of attributes than the PSO with NB classifier. The NB classifier combined with hybrid PSO feature selection method proves to be the best feature selection capability without degrading the classification accuracy. It is further proved to be an effective method for mining large structural data in much less computation time.;"[Gopalakrishnan, T.; Sengottuvelan, P.] Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Sathyamangalam, Tamil Nadu, India";Bannari Amman Institute of Technology;Sengottuvelan, P (corresponding author), Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Sathyamangalam, Tamil Nadu, India.;praveensundar604@gmail.com;"Thirumoorthy, Gopalakrishnan/X-3246-2019; P, Dr Sengottuvelan/ABA-3923-2021";Thirumoorthy, Gopalakrishnan/0000-0002-3124-322X;;;;;17;5;5;0;26;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0033-0337;1758-7301;;PROGRAM-ELECTRON LIB;Program-Electron.

A sexual problem is complicated and affects the quality of the client's life, and proper care requires the nurse to understand a variety of sex-related issues. Therefore, effective sex education for nursing students is necessary to prepare them for potential challenges from the client's sexual problems. In this study, we developed a simulation-problem-based sex education program for nursing students. The program immerses the students in a sex-related clinical situation to train them with nursing assessment, intervention skills, patient safety, patient privacy, and communication skills. To evaluate the effect of the program on the student's sexual knowledge and attitude, we provided the experimental group with simulation-problem-based sex education program along with traditional lectures, whereas the control group received only lectures. As a result, there were statistically significant differences in the improvement of knowledge (P < .05) and attitude (P < .05) of the two groups. The results show that the designed program effectively promotes nursing students' sexual knowledge and sexual attitude, and the simulation-problem-based learning is a practical and systematic approach to the sex education of nursing students.;"[Kim, Miok] Namseoul Univ, Dept Nursing, Chunahn, Choongnam, South Korea; [Shin, Minho] Myongji Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 116 Myongji Ro, Cheoingu 449728, Yongin, South Korea";"Namseoul University; Myongji University";Shin, M (corresponding author), Myongji Univ, Dept Comp Engn, 116 Myongji Ro, Cheoingu 449728, Yongin, South Korea.;mhshin@mju.ac.kr;;;National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014R1A1A1008581];National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government);This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea Grant, funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014R1A1A1008581).;;26;10;13;0;10;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1538-2931;1538-9774;;CIN-COMPUT INFORM NU;CIN-Comput.

Both students' preferences and skills play an important role in choosing the degree that best fits them, so an analysis of these attitudes during the high school can minimize the drop out in a posteriori learning period like university. We propose a subgroup discovery algorithm based on grammars to extract itemsets and relationships that represent any type of homogeneity and regularity in data from a supervised context. This supervised context is cornerstone, considering a single item or a set of them as interesting and distinctive. The proposed algorithm supports the students' final degree decision by extracting relations among different students' skills and preferences during the high school period. The idea is to be able to provide advices with regard to what is the best degree option for each specific skill and student. In this regard, the use of grammars is essential since it enables subjective and external knowledge to be included during the mining process. The proposed algorithm has been compared against different subgroup discovery algorithms, achieving excellent results.

Due to the introduction of overall cost as a metric, the traditional use of the highest-end computing configuration is no longer the most obvious choice. Moreover, the unique runtime dynamics and configuration choices of Cloud and VM platforms introduce new design considerations and runtime characteristics specific to PDES over Cloud/VMs. Here, an empirical study is presented to help understand the dynamics, trends, and trade-offs in executing PDES on Cloud/VM platforms. Performance and cost measures obtained from multiple PDES applications executed on the Amazon EC2 Cloud and on a high-end VM host machine reveal new, counterintuitive VM-PDES dynamics and guidelines. One of the critical aspects uncovered is the fundamental mismatch in hypervisor scheduler policies designed for general Cloud workloads versus the virtual time ordering needed for PDES workloads. This insight is supported by experimental data revealing the gross deterioration in PDES performance traceable to VM scheduling policy. To overcome this fundamental problem, the design and implementation of a new deadlock-free scheduler algorithm are presented, optimized specifically for PDES applications on VMs. The scalability of our scheduler has been tested in up to 128 VMs multiplexed on 32 cores, showing significant improvement in the runtime relative to the default Cloud/VM scheduler. The observations, algorithmic design, and results are timely for emerging Cloud/VM-based installations, highlighting the need for PDES-specific support in high-performance discrete event simulations on Cloud/VM platforms.;"[Yoginath, Srikanth B.; Perumalla, Kalyan S.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN USA";"United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory";Yoginath, SB (corresponding author), 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.;;;"Yoginath, Srikanth/0000-0001-8423-6050; Perumalla, Kalyan/0000-0002-7458-0832";;;;;23;21;22;0;5;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1049-3301;1558-1195;;ACM T MODEL COMPUT S;ACM Trans.

T.";;;An architecture and algorithm for context-aware resource allocation for digital teaching platforms;IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;;;English;Article;;;;;;;RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS;Digital teaching platforms (DTPs) are aimed to support personalization of classroom education to help optimize the learning process. A trend for research and development exists regarding methods to analyze multimodal data, aiming to infer how students interact with delivered content and understanding student behavior, academic performance, and the way teachers react to student engagement. Existing DTPs can deliver several types of insights, some of which teachers can use to adjust learning activities in real-time. These technologies require a computing infrastructure capable of collecting and analyzing large volumes of data, and for this, cloud computing is an ideal candidate solution. Nonetheless, preliminary field tests with DTPs demonstrate that applying fully remote services is prohibitive in scenarios with limited bandwidth and a constrained communication infrastructure. Therefore, we propose an architecture for DTPs and an algorithm to promote the adjustable balance between local and federated cloud resources. The solution works by deciding where tasks should be executed, based on resource availability and the quality of insights they may provide to teachers during learning sessions. In this work, we detail the system architecture, describe a proof-of-concept, and discuss the viability of the proposed approach for practical scenarios.;"[Koch, F.

The program can illustrate a moving particle with its position, velocity, and acceleration. It can also draw the angular position-time figure, angular velocity-time figure, and angular acceleration-time figure. Students were divided into 4 groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A used only traditional teaching methods without computer simulations. Group B used 20% of class time to see demos of the computer simulations that were controlled by instructors only. Group C used 20% of the class time in using the simulation programs which were controlled by the individual student. Group D used 20% of the class time to see demos controlled by the instructors and complete an in-class handout that was closely related to the simulations. The results showed that Students in Groups B, C, and D did better on the examination. This suggested that the computer simulations helped students understand the motions more clearly. Students in group D had the best test scores and the most positive responses to the teaching and learning. This suggested that a handout closely related to the computer simulations would greatly help students understand the topic more precisely. Only students in Group C could control the simulation by themselves, but the learning result of Group C was not the best. This suggested that many students did not know how to learn through interaction with computers. Most of the students learn more from the demos controlled by the instructors and a closely related handout. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Reasons for this data surge are many and include the introduction of new business models, technical innovations, the popularity of online games, and the increasing persistence of games. Irrespective of the causes, the proliferation of behavioral data poses the problem of how to derive insights therefrom. Behavioral data sets can be large, time-dependent and high-dimensional. Clustering offers a way to explore such data and to discover patterns that can reduce the overall complexity of the data. Clustering and other techniques for player profiling and play style analysis have, therefore, become popular in the nascent field of game analytics. However, the proper use of clustering techniques requires expertise and an understanding of games is essential to evaluate results. With this paper, we address game data scientists and present a review and tutorial focusing on the application of clustering techniques to mine behavioral game data. Several algorithms are reviewed and examples of their application shown. Key topics such as feature normalization are discussed and open problems in the context of game analytics are pointed out.;"[Bauckhage, Christian; Sifa, Rafet] Fraunhofer IAIS, Augustin, Germany; [Drachen, Anders] Aalborg Univ, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark";Aalborg University;Bauckhage, C (corresponding author), Fraunhofer IAIS, Augustin, Germany.;"christian.bauckhage@iais.fraunhofer.de; drachen@hum.aau.dk; rafet.sifa@iais.fraun-hofer.de";"Drachen, Anders/L-4690-2017; Bauckhage, Christian/M-7872-2014";"Drachen, Anders/0000-0002-1002-0414; Bauckhage, Christian/0000-0001-6615-2128";;;;;51;56;58;1;13;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1943-068X;1943-0698;;IEEE T COMP INTEL AI;IEEE Trans.

Nevertheless, the relationship between different types of interactions and learning outcomes is rather complex. Analyzing 204 offerings of 29 courses, over the period of six years, this study aimed at expanding the current understanding of the nature of this relationship. Specifically, with the use of trace data about interactions and utilizing the multilevel linear mixed modeling techniques, the study examined whether frequency and duration of student student, student instructor, student system, and student content interactions had an effect of learning outcomes, measured as final course grades. The findings show that the time spent on student system interactions had a consistent and positive effect on the learning outcome, while the quantity of student content interactions was negatively associated with the final course grades. The study also showed the importance of the educational level and the context of individual courses for the interaction types supported. Our findings further confirmed the potential of the use of trace data and learning analytics for studying learning and teaching in online settings. However, further research should account for various qualitative aspects of the interactions used while learning, different pedagogical/media features, as well as for the course design and delivery conditions in order to better explain the association between interaction types and the learning achievement. Finally, the results might imply the need for the development of the institutional and program-level strategies for learning and teaching that would promote effective pedagogical approaches to designing and guiding interactions in online and distance learning settings.

To overcome these difficulties some instructors suggest combining simulations' design while learning physics, claiming that the programming process forces the students to understand the physical mechanism activating the simulation. This study took place in a computational-science course where high-school students programmed simulations of physical systems, thus combining computer science (CS) and mathematics with physics learning. The study explored the ways in which CS affected the students' conceptual understanding of the physics behind formulas. The major part of the analysis process was qualitative, although some quantitative analysis was applied as well. Findings revealed that a great amount of the time was invested by the students on representing their physics knowledge in terms of computer science. Three knowledge domains were found to be applied: structural, procedural and systemic. A fourth domain which enabled reflection on the knowledge was found as well, the domain of execution. Each of the domains was found to promote the emergence of knowledge integration processes (Linn & Eylon, 2006, 2011), thus promoting students' physics conceptual understanding. Based on these findings, some instructional implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Question of how to understand a situation of physical system by estimating process parameters is largely unexplored. This paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial automation over relay-assisted WSNs. Different from most existing works on WSN with homogeneous sensor nodes, the network considered in this paper consists of two types of nodes, i.e., sensing nodes (SNs), which is capable of sensing and computing, and relay nodes (RNs), which is only capable of simple data aggregation. We first adopt a Kalman filtering (KF) approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters. In order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the KF algorithm in relay-assisted WSNs, a tree-based broadcasting strategy is provided for distributed sensor fusion. With the fused information, the consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs, respectively. The proposed method is applied to estimate the slab temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system, which is a typical industrial CPS. It is demonstrated that the introduction of RNs improves temperature estimation efficiency and accuracy compared with the homogeneous WSN with SNs only.;"[Chen, Cailian; Wang, Yiyin; Guan, Xinping] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Chen, Cailian; Wang, Yiyin; Guan, Xinping] Minist Educ China, Key Lab Syst Control & Informat Proc, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Chen, Cailian; Wang, Yiyin; Guan, Xinping] Cyber Joint Innovat Ctr, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jing; Yang, Xian] Yanshan Univ, Inst Elect Engn, Qinhuangdao 066004, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ning] Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada";"Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Yanshan University; University of Waterloo";Chen, CL (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;cailianchen@sjtu.edu.cn;"Yan, Jing/AAD-6934-2019; chen, cailian/HDO-8245-2022; Lu, Ning/AFC-9176-2022";;"National Science Foundation of China [U1405251, 61273181, 61221003, 61290322, 61174127]; Ministry of Education, China [NCET-13-0358, 20110073120025]; Science and Technology Commission through Shanghai Municipality, China [13QA1401900]; Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China [B832, 14LGA010]";"National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education, China(Ministry of Education, China); Science and Technology Commission through Shanghai Municipality, China; Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China";This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant U1405251, Grant 61273181, Grant 61221003, Grant 61290322, and Grant 61174127, in part by the Ministry of Education, China, under Grant NCET-13-0358 and Grant 20110073120025, in part by the Science and Technology Commission through Shanghai Municipality, China, under Grant 13QA1401900, and in part by Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, under Grant B832 and Grant 14LGA010.;;32;115;121;3;41;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2168-6750;;;IEEE T EMERG TOP COM;IEEE Trans.

It is critical to understand the general characteristics of a given embedded application: its behavior and its requirements in terms of MPSoC resources. This paper presents a complete method to study the important aspect of memory characteristic of an application. This method spans the theoretical, architecture-independent memory characterization to the quasi optimal static memory allocation of an application on a real shared-memory MPSoCs. The application is modeled as an Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) graph which is used to derive a Memory Exclusion Graph (MEG) essential for the analysis and allocation techniques. Practical considerations, such as cache coherence and memory broadcasting, are extensively treated. Memory footprint optimization is demonstrated using the example of a stereo matching algorithm from the computer vision domain. Experimental results show a reduction of the memory footprint by up to 43 % compared to a state-of-the-art minimization technique, a throughput improvement of 33 % over dynamic allocation, and the introduction of a tradeoff between multicore scheduling flexibility and memory footprint.;"[Desnos, Karol; Pelcat, Maxime; Nezan, Jean-Francois] INSA Rennes, UMR CNRS 6164, IETR, UEB, Rennes, France; [Aridhi, Slaheddine] Texas Instrument France, Villeneuve Loubet, France";"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Rennes; Universite de Rennes; Texas Instruments";Pelcat, M (corresponding author), INSA Rennes, UMR CNRS 6164, IETR, UEB, 20 Ave Buttes Coesmes, Rennes, France.;"kdesnos@insa-rennes.fr; mpelcat@insa-rennes.fr; jnezan@insa-rennes.fr; saridhi@ti.com";Pelcat, Maxime/F-6443-2014;;;;;;36;8;8;0;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1939-8018;1939-8115;;J SIGNAL PROCESS SYS;J.

However, the increased need of cooperative activities in product design process requires views incorporating Cooperative awareness information (CAI), content of which should be lean for understanding and sortable according to importance. To achieve this target, this paper proposes an Object-based cooperative awareness model (OBCWM) and corresponding multiple views system. Requirements of CAI in product design are firstly analyzed. Then OBCWM is proposed, which consists of a CPM (Core product model) based concept framework. By use of CPM, an algorithm to calculate awareness intensity is developed based on object-oriented method. To support the mechanism of OBCWM, a multiple views system is then designed with flexible view, content of which is adjustable according to awareness intensity between CAI objects. After introduction to the system, application on a case is presented, followed by the evaluation of this system. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we discuss these myths and present our experience with devising an MDSD course that challenges them and motivates students to understand MDSD principles. The main contribution of this work is a set of MDSD teaching guidelines that can make the course pragmatic in the eyes of students programmers. These guidelines introduce MDSD from the viewpoint of a programmer as a pragmatic tool for solving concrete problems in the development process. In our MDSD course we implemented the presented guidelines. The course shows several techniques and principles of model-driven development in multiple incremental iterations instead of concentrating on a single tool. At the same time we unite these techniques by using a dynamic visualisation tool that shows to the students the whole infrastructure in the big picture. The course is implemented as an iterative incremental MDSD case study.

The use of conflict graphs, however, is often questioned by the wireless community for two reasons. First, building accurate conflict graphs requires significant overhead, and hence does not scale to outdoor networks. Second, conflict graphs cannot properly capture accumulative interference. In this paper, we use large-scale measurement data as ground truth to understand how severe these problems are and whether they can be overcome. We build practical conflict graphs using measurement-calibrated propagation models, which remove the need for exhaustive signal measurements by interpolating signal strengths using calibrated models. Calibrated models are imperfect, and we study the impact of their errors on multiple steps in the process, from calibrating propagation models, predicting signal strengths, to building conflict graphs. At each step, we analyze the introduction, propagation, and final impact of errors by comparing each intermediate result to its ground-truth counterpart. Our work produces several findings. Calibrated propagation models generate location-dependent prediction errors, ultimately producing conservative conflict graphs. While these estimated conflict graphs lower spectrum utilization, their conservative nature improves reliability by reducing the impact of accumulative interference. Finally, we propose a graph augmentation technique to address remaining accumulative interference.;"[Zhou, Xia] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Zhang, Zengbin; Wang, Gang; Zhao, Ben Y.; Zheng, Haitao] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Comp Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Yu, Xiaoxiao] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China";"Dartmouth College; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Tsinghua University";Zhou, X (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;xia@cs.dartmouth.edu;Zhao, Ben/HGD-5662-2022;;;;;;53;13;14;0;3;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1063-6692;1558-2566;;IEEE ACM T NETWORK;IEEE-ACM Trans.

Using data from an open-access Web-based patient deterioration program (FIRST 2 ACTWeb), the performance of 367 Australian nursing students in identification of treatment priorities and clinical actions was analyzed using a military model of Course of Action Simulation Analysis. Participants' performance in the whole program demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge and skills (P <= .001) with high levels of participant satisfaction. Course of Action Simulation Analysis modeling identified three key participant groupings within which only 18% took the best course of action'' (the right actions and timing), with most (70%) completing the right actions but in the wrong order. The remaining 12% produced incomplete assessments and actions in an incorrect sequence. Contemporary approaches such as e-simulation do enhance educational outcomes.

The challenge arises by the nature of this course which is a combination of assembly language and hardware interface. The assembly language develops the students' ability to program in a low level programming language utilizing the instruction set of the 8086 processor, understanding the addressing modes (pointer concept), and exploring the nature of different instructions along with their execution times, dependences, implicit addressing for certain instructions, as well as flow control concerning the flags. The hardware interface helps the students in connecting various system components to build up a working system. Memory and input/output communications (read/write) operations are explained using timing diagrams and handshaking signals. In this paper, the aforementioned contents are addressed through developing an interesting project that is capable of integrating both hardware and software in an attractive environment characterized by being simple and inexpensive. In this project, the PC parallel port extension is used to emulate the microprocessor bus activity in read/write operation. The results showed an impressive students' progress whereas they were so satisfied to not only their projects, but also the conceptual basics of this course. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

One of the most important aspects of a smart home system is sensing, which is typically leveraged to observe, understand and predict the daily behavior of the occupant. This sensing of a smart home's occupant extends to personal location estimation, behavior detection, and activity monitoring. However, there is always a trade off between the amount of information that can be sensed and the loss of privacy of the occupant. Cameras coupled with state of the art computer vision algorithms can provide much more nuanced and rich information than binary sensors, like motion sensors, door sensors and so on. Unfortunately, cameras are not well tolerated by people in their homes and other private areas for privacy protection reasons. In this article, an intensive study was performed on a dataset gathered in a smart home test bed equipped with binary motion sensors. Leveraging our previous works in a concurrent activation model that describes an occupant's mobility along with the newly defined continuity property of a occupant's mobility, we propose a bipartite sensor graph with intersection sensor nodes that models a occupant's high level mobility. We then developed a trajectory propagation algorithm, which can generate an occupant's most probable trajectories and locations. We show that by using the concurrent activation events of a binary motion sensor network we can extract useful high level details of an occupant's behavior.;"[Zhang, Tongda; Wong, Kevin Bing-Yung; Aghajan, Hamid] Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";Stanford University;Zhang, TD (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;"tdzhang@stanford.edu; kbw5@stanford.edu; hamid@icdsc.org";Zhang, Tongda/Q-2343-2018;;;;;;26;5;6;0;10;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1868-5137;1868-5145;;J AMB INTEL HUM COMP;J.

Since social learning is a key element of scalable education on MOOC and is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is on understanding forum activities. Two salient features of these activities drive our research: (1) high decline rate: for each course studied, the volume of discussion declined continuously throughout the duration of the course; (2) high-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30 percent of the courses produced new threads at rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Further, a substantial portion of these discussions are not directly course-related. In our analysis, we investigate factors that are associated with the decline of activity on MOOC forums, and we find effective strategies to classify threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we first use linear regression models to analyze the forum activity count data over time, and make a number of observations; for instance, the teaching staff's active participation in the discussions is correlated with an increase in the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and to design an effective algorithm for ranking thread relevance.

Previous studies show significant associations between the personalities of software engineers and their work preferences. Objective: Various studies on personality in SE have found large, small or no effects and there is no consensus on the importance of psychometric measurements in SE. There is also a lack of studies employing other psychometric instruments or using larger datasets. We aim to evaluate our results in a larger sample, with software engineers in an earlier state of their career, using advanced statistics. Method: An operational replication study where extensive psychometric data from 279 master level students have been collected in a SE program at a Swedish University. Personality data based on the Five-Factor Model, Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and Self-compassion have been collected. Statistical analysis investigated associations between psychometrics and work preferences and the results were compared to our previous findings from 47 SE professionals. Results: Analysis confirms existence of two main clusters of software engineers; one with more intense personalities than the other. This corroborates our earlier results on SE professionals. The student data also show similar associations between personalities and work preferences. However, for other associations there are differences due to the different population of subjects. We also found connections between the emotional intelligence and work preferences, while no associations were found for self-compassion. Conclusion: The associations can help managers to predict and adapt projects and tasks to available staff. The results also show that the Emotional Intelligence instrument can be predictive. The research methods and analytical tools we employ can detect subtle associations and reflect differences between different groups and populations and thus can be important tools for future research as well as industrial practice.

It has been shown to have a significant impact on many processes on networks, including epidemic thresholds, spreading, and longevity, congestion relief, and information cascades. In a number of these results, the degree distribution (usually a power-law distribution) plays a critical role. We describe a simple but effective method for modifying a given network so as to either increase or decrease its assortativity while preserving the degree distribution of the network. The process is easily controlled to yield desired assortativities. A modification is given which not only preserves the degree of every vertex but also respects a given community structure on the network. Both algorithms are supported by detailed empirical results. The constructions should be of particular value to investigators seeking to measure the impact of assortativity in various applications without disturbing the overall degree distribution or community decompositions.;Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA;Western Kentucky University;Yang, R (corresponding author), Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.;rong.yang@wku.edu;;;;;;;36;0;0;0;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0288-3635;1882-7055;;NEW GENERAT COMPUT;New Gener.

Data from such uninstrumented environments can provide valuable knowledge to inform student learning. Analyzing such data, however, can be challenging. The complexity of students' experiences reflected from social media content requires human interpretation. However, the growing scale of data demands automatic data analysis techniques. In this paper, we developed a workflow to integrate both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. We focused on engineering students' Twitter posts to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. We first conducted a qualitative analysis on samples taken from about 25,000 tweets related to engineering students' college life. We found engineering students encounter problems such as heavy study load, lack of social engagement, and sleep deprivation. Based on these results, we implemented a multi-label classification algorithm to classify tweets reflecting students' problems. We then used the algorithm to train a detector of student problems from about 35,000 tweets streamed at the geo-location of Purdue University.

Therefore, this study proposed an E-book Reading Behavior Monitoring System based on sensing technology and e-books, with the following three stages: the analysis of a real classroom situation, system design and implementation, and an evaluation of the functionality and usability of the proposed system. This system uses a webcam and touch screen with the artificial bee colony algorithm to record data of the students' reading fixation and reading rates, which can then be used as a reference by teachers to provide individual reading guidance.

Given a set of statistical parameters, SHAREv3 program evaluates yields and therefore also ratios, and furthermore, statistical particle abundance fluctuations. The physical bulk properties of the particle source are evaluated based on all hadrons produced, including the fitted yields. The bulk properties can be prescribed as a fit input complementing and/or replacing the statistical parameters. The modifications and improvements in the SHARE suite of programs are oriented towards recent and forthcoming LHC hadron production results including charm hadrons. This SHAREv3 release incorporates all features seen previously in SHAREv1.x and v2.x and, beyond, we include a complete treatment of charm hadrons and their decays, which further cascade and feed lighter hadron yields. This article is a complete and self-contained manual explaining and introducing both the conventional and the extended capabilities of SHARE with CHARM. We complement the particle list derived from the Particle Data Group tabulation (Beringer, 2012) composed of up, down, strange u, d, s quarks (including resonances) with hadrons containing charm c, E quarks. We provide a table of the charm hadron decays including partial widths. The branching ratios of each charm hadron decay add to unity, which is achieved by including some charm hadron decay channels based on theoretical consideration in the absence of direct experimental information. A very successful interpretation of all available LHC results has been already obtained using this program.

Phys. Comm. 175 (2006) 635 Nature of problem: The understanding of hadron production incorporating the four u, d, s, c quark flavors is essential for the understanding of the properties of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the large-hadron collider (LHC) energy domain. We describe hadron production by a hot fireball within the statistical hadronization model (SHM) allowing for the chemical nonequilibrium of all quark flavors individually. By fitting particle abundances subject to bulk property constraints in the source, we find the best SHM model parameters. This approach allows the testing of physical hypotheses regarding hadron production mechanisms in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, physical properties of the source at hadronization and the validity of the statistical hadronization model itself. The abundance of light hadrons made of u, d and s constituent quarks [2] and their fluctuations [3] were the core physics contents of the prior releases SHAREv1.x and v2.x respectively. We now consider the hadronization of the heavier charm quarks, a phenomenon of relevance in the analysis of recent and forthcoming LHC results. We introduce bulk matter constraints such as a prescribed charge to baryon ratio originating in the initial state valance u and d quark content of colliding nuclei. More generally, all the bulk physical properties of the particle source such as energy, entropy, pressure, strangeness content and baryon number of the fireball at hadronization are evaluated and all of these can be used as fit constraints. The charm quark degree of freedom is handled as follows: given an input number of charm quark pairs at the time of charm chemical freeze-out, we populate charm hadron yield according to rules of statistical hadronization for a prescribed set of parameters associated with the particle source, such as bulk matter fugacities. A separate charm hadronization temperature can be chosen and fitted, and as an option it is possible to make this temperature the same as the fitted hadronization temperature of u, d, s-quarks. Charm hadron resonances decay feeding stable charm hadrons. These stable charm hadrons are so short-lived that within current technological detector capabilities practically all their decay products are feeding light hadron yields. These charm decay feeds are changing the abundances of produced hadrons in a pattern that differs from particle to particle. Solution method: SHARE with CHARM builds in its approach upon the numerical method developed for its predecessor, SHARE [2,3] for the evaluation of the distribution of light (u, d, s) hadrons. SHARE with CHARM distributes a prescribed number N-c (c) over bar of charm c + (c) over bar quarks into individual charm hadrons applying statistical hadronization rules in a newly added computation module 'CHARM' obtaining the yields evaluating appropriate series of Bessel functions. Similarly to light hadrons, the charm hadron decays are evaluated using pre-existent tables derived from PDG listing [1], proceeding from the heaviest to the lightest particle. The yields of each hadron are obtained using decay branching ratio tables of the mother particle yield where data was not available, an appropriate theoretical model was implemented to assure that all particles decayed with 100% probability. Each of the resultant daughter hadron contributions is added to this u, d, s hadron yield computed independently for the related set of SHM parameters in the SHARE module. The total yield is subsequently subject to the weak decays (WD) of strange hadrons. A user generated or default WD control file defines what portion of the u, d, s particle yield decays weakly feeding other particles in turn, and which fraction given the detection capability is observed. Once final observable hadron yields are so obtained, we compare these with the experimental data aiming in an iteration to find the best set of prescribed SHM parameters for the yield of u, d, s hadrons observed. The CHARM module is associated with two new SHM parameters, the charm hadronization temperature T-charm (which can be defaulted to T obtained for the other u, d, s hadrons) and the total yield of N-c (c) over bar = c, (c) over bar quarks, called Ncbc. These and all other SUM parameters are discussed in the text. Reasons for new version: Since the release of SHAREv1 in 2004 [2] and SHAREv2 in 2006 [3], heavy-ion collision experiments underwent major development in both detector technology and collision energy. The forthcoming tracker upgrade of STAR at BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the current tracking precision of ALICE at CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) require upgrades of the SHARE program described below. In the anticipation of significant charm abundance at LHC, SHARE with CHARM allows the study of all charm hadron production. Charm hadron decays are particularly important because they are a significant source of multistrange hadrons. The introduction of the charm component of the hadron spectrum into SHM is crucial for correct interpretation of particle production and QGP fireball properties at hadronization in heavy-ion collisions at TeV energy scale. SHARE with CHARM is an easy-to-use program, which offers a common framework for SHM analysis of all contemporary heavy-ion collision experiments for the coming years. Summary of revisions: The charm hadron mass spectrum and decays have been fully implemented in the provided program package. We provide a current up-to-date detailed list of charm hadrons and resonances together with their numerous decay channels within the set of fully updated input files that correspond to the present PDG status [1]. Considering the enhanced tracking capabilities of LHC experiments and similar RHIC capability, the default behavior of weak decay feed-down has been updated to not accept any weak feed-down unless specified otherwise by the user. The common framework for all contemporary heavy-ion experiments required an update of the format of the particle list and of the content to correspond to present day PDG. SHARE with CHARM is backward compatible with the previous release, SHAREv2, in terms of calculation capabilities and use of control files. However, the SHARE user may need to update and or add individual input file command lines in order to assure that same tasks are performed, considering that defaults, e.g., characterizing weak decays, have been modified. Furthermore quite a few interface improvements have been implemented and are described in detail further in this manual. They allow considerable simplification of control files. Running time: From a few seconds in the case of calculating hadron yields and bulk properties given a prescribed set of model parameters, to similar to 30 h in the case of fitting all parameters to experimental data and calculation with finite widths. Sample calculation provided in the program package, which demonstrates the program capabilities other than calculation with finite widths, took just under 2 h on both 2.1 GHz CPU (2 MB L2 cache) laptop and 2.5 GHz CPU (6 MB L2 cache) cluster computing node. Simple fit of model parameters to a data set(provided as default in the package) takes about 5 min. References: [1] J. Beringer et al., [Particle Data Group Collaboration], Phys. Rev.

VB is a family of deterministic probability distribution approximation procedures that offer distinct advantages over alternative approaches based on stochastic sampling and those providing only point estimates. VB inference is flexible to be applied in different practical problems, yet is broad enough to subsume as its special cases several alternative inference approaches including Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In this paper we also show the connections between VB and other posterior approximation methods such as the marginalization-based Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) and the Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithms. Specifically, both VB and EP are variational methods that minimize functionals based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. LBP, traditionally developed using graphical models, can also be viewed as a VB inference procedure. We present several multimedia related applications illustrating the use and effectiveness of the VB algorithms discussed herein. We hope that by reading this tutorial the readers will obtain a general understanding of Bayesian methods and establish connections among popular algorithms used in practice.;"[Chen, Zhaofu; Katsaggelos, Aggelos K.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Babacan, S.

Nursing educators already know and understand that they should integrate nursing informatics into the nursing curriculum to prepare future nurses for the new world of information technology. However, as of now, the core program of nursing studies in Israel does not put an emphasis on the skills required to properly use nursing informatics. The present research is the first step toward achieving this target by recognizing the importance of the human factor. The main goal is to examine the correlation between nursing students' attitudes and a number of variables: self-efficacy, threat, challenge, and innovativeness. This quantitative study used a convenience sample of nursing students in a bachelor's degree programat a large academic center in central Israel. Results show significant positive correlations between nursing students' attitudes to computer use and self-efficacy, a sense of challenge in using a computer, a sense of threat in using a computer, and previous experience with computers. The insights of these results will benefit nursing educators by helping them find creative ways to expose the students to the world of information technology and to improve the quality of future nurses.;"[Gonen, Ayala; Sharon, Dganit; Offir, Ana] Ruppin Acad Ctr, Dept Nursing, Sch Social & Community Sci, IL-4025000 Emek Hefer, Israel; [Lev-Ari, Lilac] Ruppin Acad Ctr, Dept Behav Sci, Sch Social & Community Sci, IL-4025000 Emek Hefer, Israel";"Ruppin Academic Center; Ruppin Academic Center";Gonen, A (corresponding author), Ruppin Acad Ctr, Dept Nursing, IL-4025000 Emek Hefer, Israel.;Ayala.gonen@gmail.com;"CERVANTES, EMILY/R-6274-2018; gonen, ayala/AAH-4152-2020";;;;;;36;14;20;0;22;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1538-2931;1538-9774;;CIN-COMPUT INFORM NU;CIN-Comput.

With recent re-designing of course offerings, the course is split into two separate design courses: reinforced concrete design and structural steel design. The new teaching format allows instructors to incorporate additional instruction methods in design classes that supplement traditional teaching. This article discusses the development and implementation of computational MATLAB design modules that are incorporated in the first and second offering of the new reinforced concrete design course. The main objective of the modules is to improve students' computational skills for solving routine design calculations without compromising the theoretical understanding of the subject matter. The graphical user interface driven modules are designed to include program descriptions, user-friendly field inputs, and a detailed results summary with step-by-step design verifications.

This study examined the effect of an interactive multimedia informational program with in-line exercises and corrected feedback on patients' real-time understanding of their cardiac catheterization procedure. Methods: 151 adult patients scheduled for diagnostic cardiac catheterization were randomized to receive information about their procedure using either the standard institutional verbal and written information (SI) or an interactive iPad-based informational program (IPI). Subject understanding was evaluated using semi-structured interviews at baseline, immediately following catheterization, and 2 weeks after the procedure. In addition, for those randomized to the IPI, the ability to respond correctly to several in-line exercises was recorded. Subjects' perceptions of, and preferences for the information delivery were also elicited. Results: Subjects randomized to the IPI program had significantly better understanding following the intervention compared with those randomized to the SI group (8.3 +/- 2.4 vs 7.4 +/- 2.5, respectively, 0-12 scale where 12 = complete understanding, P < 0.05). First-time correct responses to the in-line exercises ranged from 24.3% to 100%. Subjects reported that the in-line exercises were very helpful (9.1 +/- 1.7, 0-10 scale, where 10 = extremely helpful) and the iPad program very easy to use (9.0 +/- 1.6, 0-10 scale, where 10 = extremely easy) suggesting good clinical utility.;"[Tait, Alan R.; Voepel-Lewis, Terri] Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Anesthesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chetcuti, Stanley J.; Brennan-Martinez, Colleen] Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Cardiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Tait, Alan R.] Univ Michigan, Ctr Bioeth & Social Sci Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Levine, Robert] Jackson Mem Hosp, Emergency Care Ctr, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Levine, Robert] ArchieMD Inc, Boca Raton, FL USA";"University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan";Tait, AR (corresponding author), Univ Michigan Hlth Syst, Dept Anesthesiol, 1500 E Med Ctr Dr, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;atait@umich.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health; NHLBI [2R42HL087488]; National Institutes of Health (NICHD) [RO1HD053594]";"National Institutes of Health; NHLBI(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI)); National Institutes of Health (NICHD)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))";"Supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health; NHLBI (2R42HL087488) to Dr. Levine.

Determining which the most effective techniques for carrying out this activity are has been an aspiration of experimental software engineering researchers for years. This paper reports a controlled experiment evaluating the effectiveness of two unit testing techniques (the functional testing technique known as equivalence partitioning (EP) and the control-flow structural testing technique known as branch testing (BT)). This experiment is a literal replication of Juristo et al. (2013). Both experiments serve the purpose of determining whether the effectiveness of BT and EP varies depending on whether or not the faults are visible for the technique (InScope or OutScope, respectively). We have used the materials, design and procedures of the original experiment, but in order to adapt the experiment to the context we have: (1) reduced the number of studied techniques from 3 to 2; (2) assigned subjects to experimental groups by means of stratified randomization to balance the influence of programming experience; (3) localized the experimental materials and (4) adapted the training duration. We ran the replication at the Escuela Polit,cnica del Ej,rcito Sede Latacunga (ESPEL) as part of a software verification & validation course. The experimental subjects were 23 master's degree students. EP is more effective than BT at detecting InScope faults. The session/program and group variables are found to have significant effects. BT is more effective than EP at detecting OutScope faults. The session/program and group variables have no effect in this case. The results of the replication and the original experiment are similar with respect to testing techniques. There are some inconsistencies with respect to the group factor. They can be explained by small sample effects. The results for the session/program factor are inconsistent for InScope faults. We believe that these differences are due to a combination of the fatigue effect and a technique x program interaction. Although we were able to reproduce the main effects, the changes to the design of the original experiment make it impossible to identify the causes of the discrepancies for sure. We believe that further replications closely resembling the original experiment should be conducted to improve our understanding of the phenomena under study.";"[Apa, Cecilia] Univ Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Dieste, Oscar] Univ Politecn Madrid, E-28660 Madrid, Spain; [Espinosa G, Edison G.] Escuela Politecn Ejercito Sede Latacunga, Latacunga, Ecuador; [Fonseca C, Efrain R.] Escuela Politecn Ejercito, Sangolqui, Ecuador";"Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito; Escuela Politecnica Superior del Ejercito";Fonseca, ER (corresponding author), Escuela Politecn Ejercito, Sangolqui, Ecuador.;"ceapa@fing.edu.uy; odieste@fi.upm.es; egespinosa1@espe.edu.ec; erfonseca@espe.edu.ec";"Dieste, Oscar/K-6193-2014; GUTIERREZ ESPINOSA, Enrique/KEI-1923-2024";"Dieste, Oscar/0000-0002-3060-7853;";"Armed Forces Technical School (ESPE), Republic of Ecuador National Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation Secretary's Office (SENESCYT); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness project [TIN2011-23216]";"Armed Forces Technical School (ESPE), Republic of Ecuador National Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation Secretary's Office (SENESCYT); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness project";This research has been funded by a grant from the Armed Forces Technical School (ESPE), Republic of Ecuador National Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation Secretary's Office (SENESCYT) and partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness project TIN2011-23216.;;20;7;10;0;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

In this paper, we defined interaction to mean not only superficial interactions between human and systems but also internal elements inspiring one another. We proposed a new interaction model by defining four user elements namely user knowledge, information needs, thinking, and feelings, and five system elements namely system knowledge, interaction algorithm, knowledge base, retrieval algorithm, and database. The key point is that users can understand inside the systems gradually and operate them flexibly in their own way to provide real interactions where users and systems inspire one another's internal elements. We then defined system requirements to realize this model so that users can change and comprehend system knowledge and that users interact with the system constantly. We constructed an image retrieval system applying our proposed graphical search interface named Concentric Ring View and confirmed that all system requirements were satisfied. In a usability test with 12 university students, we confirmed that the proposed interaction model provided intuitive searches to users by inspiring internal elements between users and systems. Users could continuously change and comprehend system knowledge, synchronize user knowledge, shifting thinking and feeling, and changing information needs.;"[Kajiyama, Tomoko] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Chuoh Ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525258, Japan; [Satoh, Shin'ichi] Res Org Informat & Syst, Natl Inst Informat, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1018430, Japan";"Aoyama Gakuin University; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Informatics (NII) - Japan";Kajiyama, T (corresponding author), Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Chuoh Ku, 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525258, Japan.;"tomo@ise.aoyama.ac.jp; satoh@nii.ac.jp";;;"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [19860069]; Waseda University [2009B-288]; Foundation for the Fusion of Science and Technology of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19860069, 25870701, 26240016, 23300041] Funding Source: KAKEN";"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Waseda University; Foundation for the Fusion of Science and Technology of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))";This research was supported in part by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research No. 19860069 from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, Waseda University Grant for Special Research Projects No. 2009B-288, and Foundation for the Fusion of Science and Technology of Japan.

This research considers small-scale and mathematical models of simple one-story structures that are subjected to free and base-motion excitations and installed with and without passive damping devices to gain an understanding of their dynamic behavior while reviewing active and semi-active damping means being applied and researched today. Using computer programming and numerical methods, the goal is to understand and counteract catastrophic disasters to structures caused by earthquakes. The research is broken down into a number of MATLAB simulations and experiments in order to understand basic dynamic and control features required to design earthquake resilient buildings. These experiments include free vibration experiments to test for the stiffness of columns for different heights and to test for the natural frequency and damping ratio of a one-story structure under different mass loads. Active PD control was then applied to an experimental system experiencing accelerations attributed to the Northridge 1994, Kobe 1995, El Centro 1940, and Mendocino 1992 earthquakes. Robustness comparisons were made between (1) P control; (2) D control; and (3) PD control for the above earthquake inputs to the shaker. A fuzzy logic controller was developed to effectively control transient vibrations. The uniqueness of this control concept is that the fuzzy control continuously varies the damping characteristics of a semi-active tuned mass damper (TMD). It was concluded that a fuzzy logic based TMD was more effective than a regular passive TMD, by providing half the settling times. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This program can also be used in environmental and toxicological studies and preclinical simulation, to facilitate communication between modeling pharmacokineticists and project leaders or other decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry. The program simulates the drug delivery and transport by means of (I) a six-compartment physiological pharmacokinetic flow model, (II) a system of traditional compartment models, or (III) a target-mediated drug disposition system. The program also can be used to simulate instantaneous equilibria between concentration and pharmacodynamic response, or as temporal delays between concentration and response. The latter is done by means of turnover models (indirect response models). Drug absorption, distribution, and elimination are represented by differential equations, which are described by organ and tissue volumes or other volumes of distribution, blood flows, clearance terms, and tissue-to-blood partition coefficients. The user can control and adjust these parameters by means of a slider in real time. By interactively changing the parameter values and simultaneously displaying the resulting concentration-time and/or response-time profiles, users can understand the major mechanisms that govern the disposition or the pharmacological response of the drug in the organism in real time. Schedule dependence is typically seen in clinical practice with a non-linear concentration-response relationship, and is difficult to communicate except via simulations. Here, we sought to illustrate the potential advantages of this approach in teaching pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics to undergraduate pharmacy-, veterinary-, and medical students or to project teams in drug discovery/development.

However, basic Wikis have limited features in terms of catering for various roles and responsibilities of users causing hindrance for effective collaborative work among them. Hence, it is important to investigate how these varying roles can band together in a CSCL environment. This research recommends an iterative model with defined users and roles working in a collaborative environment. The study underwent a 3-week exercise, involving 16 participants belonging to the Bachelor of Information Technology program at a university in Malaysia. Data collected from these participants helped in evaluating the model proposed. Data collection techniques involved structured surveys and structured interviews to understand participants' perceptions during collaborative work (group assignment). The results gathered from the surveys were statistically tested using the non-parametric statistical test named Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The proposed iterative model encouraged the students to be more active and responsible in the CSCL environment. Studyshowed that the inclusion of users and their roles helped in managing and performing group tasks. The research identified lists of users and roles working within the CSCL environment. The iterative model supported theseusers and roles, monitoring their progress using process checks.;"[Shah, Asad Ali; Ravana, Sri Devi] Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia";Universiti Malaya;Shah, AA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;"asad.shah@siswa.um.edu.my; sdevi@um.edu.my";"Shah, Asad/JHU-4142-2023; Ravana, Sri Devi/O-2966-2018; Shah, Asad/U-6508-2019; RAVANA, SRI DEVI/B-9833-2010";"Shah, Asad/0000-0001-9293-5919; Ravana, Sri Devi/0000-0002-5637-9158";"University of Malaya Flagship Grant [FL001-2012]; University of Malaya Research Grant UMRG [RG093/12ICT]";"University of Malaya Flagship Grant; University of Malaya Research Grant UMRG";The preparation of this manuscript has been supported by University of Malaya Flagship Grant (FL001-2012) and University of Malaya Research Grant UMRG (RG093/12ICT).;;33;2;2;0;6;UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH;KUALA LUMPUR;UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH, KUALA LUMPUR, 50603, MALAYSIA;0127-9084;;;MALAYS J COMPUT SCI;Malayas.

These are frequently related to the fact that the teacher cannot clearly know the learning status of students, such as their degree of learning concentration and capacity to absorb knowledge. In order to deal with this situation, this study uses a learning concentration detection system (LCDS), combining sensor technology and an artificial intelligence method, to better understand the learning concentration of students in a learning environment. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system uses sensing technology to collect information about the learning behavior of the students, analyzes their concentration levels, and applies an artificial intelligence method to combine this information for use by the teacher. This system includes a pressure detection sensor and facial detection sensor to detect facial expressions, eye activities and body movements. The system utilizes an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize the system performance to help teachers immediately understand the degree of concentration and learning status of their students. Based on this, instructors can give appropriate guidance to several unfocused students at the same time. Findings - The fitness value and computation time were used to evaluate the LCDS. Comparing the results of the proposed ABC algorithm with those from the random search method, the algorithm was found to obtain better solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the ABC algorithm can quickly obtain near optimal solutions within a reasonable time. Originality/value - A learning concentration detection method of integrating context-aware technologies and an ABC algorithm is presented in this paper. Using this learning concentration detection method, teachers can keep abreast of their students' learning status in a teaching environment and thus provide more appropriate instruction.;"[Su, Yen-Ning; Hsu, Chia-Cheng; Chen, Hsin-Chin; Huang, Yueh-Min] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Huang, Kuo-Kuang] Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Management, Magong, Taiwan";"National Cheng Kung University; National Penghu University of Science & Technology";Huang, YM (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.;huang@mail.ncku.edu.tw;;;National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan, Republic of China [NSC 101-2511-S-041-001-MY3, NSC 100-2511-S-006-015-MY3, NSC 100-2218-E-006-017];National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan, Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan);This work was supported by the National Science Council (NSC), Taiwan, Republic of China, under Contracts No. NSC 101-2511-S-041-001-MY3, NSC 100-2511-S-006-015-MY3, and NSC 100-2218-E-006-017.;;51;5;7;1;24;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0264-4401;1758-7077;;ENG COMPUTATION;Eng.

Developers often search the internet and other code databases for necessary source code snippets to ease the development efforts. Code search techniques also help learn programming as novice programmers or students can quickly retrieve (hopefully good) examples already used in actual software projects. Given the recurrence of the code search activity in software development, there is an increasing interest in the research community. To improve the code search experience, the research community suggests many code search tools and techniques. These tools and techniques leverage several different ideas and claim a better code search performance. However, it is still challenging to illustrate a comprehensive view of the field considering that existing studies generally explore narrow and limited subsets of used components. This study aims to devise a grounded approach to understanding the procedure for code search and build an operational taxonomy capturing the critical facets of code search techniques.

Our aim was to identify unique groups of readers using an unsupervised statistical learning technique - cluster analysis. Six indicators generated from the students' log files were included to provide insights into engagement and learning across four different reading -related skills: phonological awareness, early decoding, vocabulary, and comprehension processes. A key aim was to evaluate the implementation and performance of Gaussian mixture models, kmeans, k-medoids, clustering large applications and hierarchical clustering, alongside provision of detailed guidance that can benefit researchers in the field. K -means algorithm performed the best and identified nine groups of readers. Children with low initial reading ability showed greater engagement with code -related games (phonological awareness, early decoding) and took longer to master these games, whereas children with higher initial ability showed more engagement with meaning -related games (vocabulary, comprehension processes).

However, error messages have often been based on either anecdotal evidence or expert opinion, disregarding novices, who arguably are the ones who benefit the most from effective error messages. Furthermore, the usability aspects of Structured Query Language (SQL) error messages have not received much scientific attention. In this mixed-methods study, we coded a total of 128 error messages from eight database management systems (DBMS), and using data from 311 participants, analysed 4,796 queries using regression analysis to find out if and how acknowledged error message qualities explain SQL syntax error fixing success rates. Additionally, we performed a conventional content analysis on 1,505 suggestions on how to improve SQL error messages, and based on the analysis, formulated a framework consisting of nine guidelines for SQL error message design. The results indicate that general error message qualities do not necessarily explain query fixing success in the context of SQL syntax errors and that even some novel NewSQL systems fail to account for basic error message design guidelines. The error message design framework and examples of its practical applications shown in this study are applicable in educational contexts as well as by DBMS vendors in understanding novice perspectives in error message design.;"[Taipalus, Toni; Grahn, Hilkka] Univ Jyvaskyla, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland";University of Jyvaskyla;Taipalus, T (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.;"toni.taipalus@jyu.fi; hilkka.grahn@jyu.fi";;"Taipalus, Toni/0000-0003-4060-3431; Grahn, Hilkka/0000-0001-7567-7807";;;;;64;2;2;1;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA;1049-331X;1557-7392;;ACM T SOFTW ENG METH;ACM Trans.

When teachers understand the nature of these errors and how students correct them, instruction can be more effective. Some errors occur more frequently than others. In this paper, we examine the most common programming errors made by beginning first -year high school gifted mathematics students in Mathematical High School. Notwithstanding the extensive coverage of these error types in lectures and learning materials, we found that these errors still occur when students write programs. Our results suggest that students who habitually make all common errors have lower grades, but even excellent students make logical errors in loop conditions. Therefore, we advise more practice in logical reasoning for novice programmers and an introduction to formal semantics.;"[Radakovic, Davorka] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Steingartner, William] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Kosice, Slovakia";"University of Novi Sad; Technical University Kosice";Radakovic, D (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia.;"davorkar@dmi.uns.ac.rs; william.steingartner@tuke.sk";Radakovic, Davorka/B-7225-2016;"Radakovic, Davorka/0000-0001-8480-3211; Steingartner, William/0000-0002-2852-9403";;;;;35;1;1;1;1;IPSI BELGRADE LTD;BELGRADE;DALMATINSKA 55, BELGRADE, 00000, SERBIA;1820-4503;;;IPSI BDG TRANS INTER;IPSI BgD Trans.

However, the reading comprehension training typically focuses on the skill level required for a standardized learning stage, without considering the impact of individual differences in linguistic competence. This article presents a personalized support system for reading comprehension, named chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT)-based personalized reading comprehension support (ChatPRCS), based on the zone of proximal development (ZPD) theory. It leverages the advanced capabilities of large language models, exemplified by ChatGPT. ChatPRCS employs methods, including skill prediction, question generation and automatic evaluation, to enhance reading comprehension instruction. First, a ZPD-based algorithm is developed to predict students' reading comprehension skills. This algorithm analyzes historical data to generate questions with appropriate difficulty. Second, a series of ChatGPT prompt patterns is proposed to address two key aspects of reading comprehension objectives: question generation, and automated evaluation. These patterns further improve the quality of generated questions. Finally, by integrating personalized skill prediction and reading comprehension prompt patterns, ChatPRCS is validated through a series of experiments. Empirical results demonstrate that it provides learners with high-quality reading comprehension questions that are broadly aligned with expert-crafted questions at a statistical level. Furthermore, this study investigates the effect of the system on learning achievement, learning motivation, and cognitive load, providing further evidence of its effectiveness in instructing English reading comprehension.;"[Wang, Xizhe; Zhong, Yihua; Huang, Changqin] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applic, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiaodi] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Comp Math & Engn, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia";"Zhejiang Normal University; Charles Sturt University";Huang, CQ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Intelligent Educ Technol & Applic, Jinhua 321004, Peoples R China.;"xzwang@zjnu.edu.cn; yiwer007@zjnu.edu.cn; cqhuang@zju.edu.cn; xhuang@csu.edu.au";"Zhang, Yuqing/KSM-6924-2024; Huang, Xiaodi/E-9204-2012";"Huang, Xiaodi/0000-0002-6084-1851; Huang, Changqin/0000-0003-1371-2608; Zhong, Yihua/0009-0009-8966-8595";National Science and Technology Major;National Science and Technology Major;No Statement Available;;58;0;0;18;18;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

J;Wei, YF;;;;Wei, Yufen;;;Building an adaptive test model for English reading comprehension in the context of online education;SERVICE ORIENTED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Online education; English; Reading comprehension; Multi-stage; Adaptive";;With the ongoing progress of economic globalization, international communication has witnessed a notable surge. Proficiency in English has become indispensable for individuals seeking to comprehend international information and engage in economic, cultural, and scientific exchanges. At the heart of English instruction lies English reading, and using models to test scientific English reading comprehension abilities can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of learning. This study aims to augment the quality of adaptive English reading comprehension tests and accurately gage the assessment of college students' English reading abilities. In this research endeavor, the difficulty of objective questions in English reading comprehension was quantified by amalgamating deviance entropy and fuzzy hierarchical analysis. Subsequently, a hybrid test model grounded in Rasch was devised with multiple adaptive algorithms. The test results unveiled that the weighting values of the objective question difficulty model, based on fuzzy hierarchical analysis, changed, ranging from 0.551 to 0.562 for content and from 0.449 to 0.438 for question type. The mean ability values of the 40 students spanned from - 3 to + 3 logits, with the dwell time exhibiting a distribution pattern. Compared with the traditional adaptive test model, the hybrid adaptive test model employed 22.25 questions, resulting in an overlap rate of 0.21. The time taken to assemble the paper was a mere 0.05 s, accompanied by a reduction in difficulty by 0.32, leading to an impressive test efficiency of 98%. The findings of this study underscore that the adaptive model developed herein offers superior ability assessment and effectively enhances students' English reading comprehension learning.;[Wei, Yufen] Weinan Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Weinan 714099, Peoples R China;Weinan Normal University;Wei, YF (corresponding author), Weinan Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Weinan 714099, Peoples R China.;Yufen_Wei2023@outlook.com;;;Research on Digital Protection and Innovative Dissemination Mechanism of Weinan Intangible Cultural Heritage Under Network Media;Research on Digital Protection and Innovative Dissemination Mechanism of Weinan Intangible Cultural Heritage Under Network Media;No Statement Available;;35;0;0;2;2;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1863-2386;1863-2394;;SERV ORIENTED COMPUT;Serv.

Students vary substantially in their ability to understand complex and abstract topics in computer programming logic, such as loop logic, function recursion, arrays, passing parameters, and program structure design. Cooperative learning is an effective method of learning and teaching programming. In traditional cooperative learning, students group themselves, or teachers group students intuitively. This paper proposes a clustering method based on item response theory (IRT) and the revised Girvan - Newman clustering for clustering students by learning ability. Item response theory calculated the learner's ability and interpersonal relatio nship questionnaire generated by the social network analysis.

For instance, many works rely on traditional computer vision methods, which may not perform well in dynamic and realistic environments. Recently, a widespread trend has emerged, leveraging deep learning for HPE specifically framed as a regression task; however, considering the real-time applications, the problem could be better formulated as classification (e.g., left, centre, right head pose and gaze) using a hybrid approach. For the first time, we present a complete facial profiling approach to extract micro and macro facial movement, gaze, and eye state features, which can be used for various applications related to comprehension analysis. The multimodel approach provides discrete human-understandable head pose estimations utilising deep transfer learning, a newly introduced method of head roll calculation, gaze estimation via iris detection, and eye state estimation (i. e., open or closed). Unlike existing works, this approach can automatically analyse the input image or video frame to produce human-understandable binary codes (e.g., eye open or close, looking left or right, etc.) for each facial component (aka face channels). The proposed approach is validated on multiple standard datasets, indicating outperformance compared to existing methods in several aspects, including reliability, generalisation, completeness, and interpretability.

ChatGPT, based on GPT-3.5 architecture, has shown great promise for revolutionizing various research fields, including code generation. However, the reliability and quality of code generated by ChatGPT remain unexplored, raising concerns about potential risks associated with the widespread use of ChatGPT-driven code generation. In this article, we systematically study the quality of 4,066 ChatGPT-generated programs of code implemented in two popular programming languages, i.e., Java and Python, for 2,033 programming tasks. The goal of this work is threefold. First, we analyze the correctness of ChatGPT on code generation tasks and uncover the factors that influence its effectiveness, including task difficulty, programming language, time that tasks are introduced, and program size. Second, we identify and characterize potential issues with the quality of ChatGPT-generated code. Last, we provide insights into how these issues can be mitigated. Experiments highlight that out of 4,066 programs generated by ChatGPT, 2,756 programs are deemed correct, 1,082 programs provide wrong outputs, and 177 programs contain compilation or runtime errors. Additionally, we further analyze other characteristics of the generated code through static analysis tools, such as code style and maintainability, and find that 1,930 ChatGPT-generated code snippets suffer from maintainability issues. Subsequently, we investigate ChatGPT's self-repairing ability and its interaction with static analysis tools to fix the errors uncovered in the previous step. Experiments suggest that ChatGPT can partially address these challenges, improving code quality by more than 20%, but there are still limitations and opportunities for improvement. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the current limitations of ChatGPT and offers a roadmap for future research and development efforts to enhance the code generation capabilities of artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT.;"[Liu, Yue; Tantithamthavorn, Chakkrit] Monash Univ, Clayton, Australia; [Liu, Yue; Widyasari, Ratnadira; Lo, David] Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Le-Cong, Thanh; Le, Xuan-Bach D.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; [Li, Li] Beihang Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Monash University; Singapore Management University; University of Melbourne; Beihang University";Tantithamthavorn, C (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Clayton, Australia.;"yue.liu1@monash.edu; congthanh.le@student.unimelb.edu.au; ratnadiraw.2020@phdcs.smu.edu.sg; chakkrit@monash.edu; lilicoding@ieee.org; bach.le@unimelb.edu.au; davidlo@smu.edu.sg";"; Lo, David/A-2493-2012";"Tantithamthavorn, Chakkrit/0000-0002-5516-9984; Li, Li/0000-0003-2990-1614; Le-Cong, Thanh/0000-0002-9566-324X; Lo, David/0000-0002-4367-7201; Liu, Yue/0000-0002-5593-5917";"National Research Foundation under its Investigatorship Grant [NRFNRFI08-2022-0002]; Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) [DE200100941]; Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) [DE220101057]; Google";"National Research Foundation under its Investigatorship Grant; Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA)(Australian Research Council); Australian Government through the Australian Research Council's Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA); Google(Google Incorporated)";This research/project is supported by the National Research Foundation under its Investigatorship Grant (grant no.

This is due to the continual development of scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and computational tools that help to extract knowledge from raw data efficiently and cost-effectively, compared with early-generation tools. Professional data scientists create code that processes, analyses and extracts actionable insights from high volumes of data. This process requires a deep understanding of mathematical principles, statistics, business knowledge, and computer science. But most importantly, the data science development chain requires knowledge of a high-level programming tool and its dependencies. This is a major problem in some aspects due to the steep learning curve. In this paper, we describe and present a modularized Data Science curriculum for undergraduate learners that relies on no-code software development tools as programming aids for non-computer science majors. No-code development tools have been added to the traditional teaching pedagogy to improve students' motivation and conceptual understanding of coding despite their limited programming skills. The study aims to assess the impacts of visual programming languages on the performance of non-computer science majors on programming problems. The study's sample consists of 50 fourth-year students from the Faculty of Science and Technology at the Midlands State University. A post-survey questionnaire and assessment items were administered to the control and experimental groups.

Different models are proposed by inserting text and generating questions; however, the challenge is understanding the concepts in the code snippets and linking them to the lessons so that the model can generate relevant and reasonable questions for students. Therefore, the standards applied to measure the results are the code complexity and question validity regarding the questions. The method used to achieve this goal combines the QuestionGenAi framework and ontology based on semantic code conversion. The results produced are questions based on the code snippets provided. The evaluation criteria were code complexity, question validity, and question context. This work has great potential improvement to the e-learning platforms to improve the overall experience for both learners and instructors.";"[Alshboul, Jawad; Baksa-Varga, Erika] Univ Miskolc, Fac Mech Engn & Informat, Miskolc, Hungary";University of Miskolc;Alshboul, J (corresponding author), Univ Miskolc, Fac Mech Engn & Informat, Miskolc, Hungary.;;;;Institute of Information Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Informatics, University of Miskolc;Institute of Information Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Informatics, University of Miskolc;The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial assistance from the Institute of Information Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Informatics, University of Miskolc.;;19;0;0;0;0;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

Existing models typically reconstruct the multimodal relationships to ground targets by utilizing off -the -shelf information, and ignore to further exploit helpful knowledge to enhance the model performance. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive knowledge distillation architecture to enrich the predominant pattern of weakly supervised REC and transfer the target -aware and interaction -aware knowledge from a pre -trained teacher grounder to enhance the grounding performance of the student model. Specifically, in order to encourage the teacher to impart more reliable knowledge, we present a Knowledge Confidence -Based Adaptive Temperature (KCAT) learning approach to learn optimal temperatures to transfer the target -aware and interaction -aware knowledge with higher prediction confidence. Moreover, to urge the student to absorb more helpful knowledge, we introduce a Student Competency -Based Adaptive Weight (SCAW) learning strategy to dynamically integrate the distilled target -aware and interactionaware knowledge to enhance the student's grounding certainty. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with the aid of adaptive knowledge distillation and integration.

J;Falloon, G;;;;Falloon, Garry;;;Advancing young students' computational thinking: An investigation of structured curriculum in early years primary schooling;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Computational thinking; Coding; Kindergarten; Early years' education; Curriculum; Guided inquiry; Structured";ROBOTICS;In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a '21St Century' competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problembased methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.;[Falloon, Garry] Federat Univ Australia, Inst Educ Arts & Community, Mt Helen, Vic 3350, Australia;Federation University Australia;Falloon, G (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Inst Educ Arts & Community, Mt Helen, Vic 3350, Australia.;g.falloon@federation.edu.au;;Falloon, Garry/0000-0002-6369-8771;;;;;52;1;1;21;21;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

This paper presents a study that investigates the experiences of part-time undergraduate students using ChatGPT in a five-week Java programming course. After each exercise, students provided feedback via anonymous surveys in which they rated different suitability aspects of ChatGPT. The majority viewed ChatGPT positively and suitable for learning programming concepts. However, its suitability for specific implementation tasks received mixed reviews. Students found it easy to adapt ChatGPT's generated code to the exercises' implementation tasks. The students primarily used it for acquiring background knowledge, learning syntax and programming concepts and suggesting suitable algorithms. Yet, some abstained from using it due to concerns to not garner sufficient programming proficiency, retrieving partially incorrect or misleading generated code, preferring an independent working style, or general skepticism about its benefits. Finally, in response to our findings, we also discuss three perspective directions for improving the suitability of LLM chatbots for students in programming education.;"[Haindl, Philipp; Weinberger, Gerald] St Polten Univ Appl Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Secur, A-3100 St Polten, Austria";St. Polten University of Applied Sciences;Haindl, P (corresponding author), St Polten Univ Appl Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Secur, A-3100 St Polten, Austria.;philipp.haindl@fhstp.ac.at;;Haindl, Philipp/0000-0001-6075-5286;;;;;32;2;2;53;53;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2024;12;;;;;;43519;43529;;10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3380909;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3380909;;;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";ML3S0;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001193742900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This article analyzes the application of entertainment E-learning mode based on Apriori algorithm in intelligent English reading assistance mode. At present, English reading teaching faces some problems, such as outdated teaching methods, passive learning among students, excessive emphasis on imparting grammar knowledge while neglecting the improvement of students' reading skills and strategies, and so on. Therefore, this article conducts research on intelligent English reading comprehension tools based on semantic analysis and Apriori algorithm. This paper proposes a recreational E-learning model based on Apriori algorithm. Based on Apriori algorithm, students' interests and preferences on different learning resources and entertainment elements are mined and incorporated into the learning model design. Then, a set of entertaining English reading assistant model is designed, which uses a variety of entertainment elements, such as gamified learning, interactive activities and reward mechanism, to increase students' learning participation and enthusiasm. This article adopts the idea of LSA algorithm to construct a BERT semantic analysis model. We treat nodes in the network as word items and then use singular value decomposition algorithm to decompose the word document matrix. Secondly, the original association rule Apriori algorithm was optimized, and the optimized association rule Apriori algorithm effectively solved the problem of excessive computation in traditional algorithms. Finally, based on semantic analysis and Apriori algorithm, this article designs an intelligent English reading comprehension tool, mainly analyzing the practical application of the system and greatly improving the efficiency of English reading teaching.;[Liu, Shanshan] Shangqiu Med Coll, English Teaching & Res Dept, Shangqiu 476100, Henan, Peoples R China;;Liu, SS (corresponding author), Shangqiu Med Coll, English Teaching & Res Dept, Shangqiu 476100, Henan, Peoples R China.;zhezheshan@163.com;;;;;;;15;0;0;2;2;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;London;125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND;1875-9521;1875-953X;;ENTERTAIN COMPUT;Entertain.

However, occurring errors, often referred to as bugs in code, can indeed be challenging to identify and rectify, both for students who are learning to program and for experienced professionals. These errors can lead to unexpected behaviors in programming. Understanding, finding, and effectively dealing with errors is an integral part of programming learning as well as software development. To classify the errors, we propose a multi-label error classification of source code for dealing with programming data by using the ML-KNN classifier with CodeT5 embeddings. In addition, several deep neural network (DNN) models, including GRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and BiLSTM-A (attention mechanism) are also employed as baseline models to classify the errors. We trained all the models by using a large-scale dataset (original error labels) as well as modified datasets (summarized error labels) of the source code. The average classification accuracy of the proposed model is 95.91% and 84.77% for the original and summarized error-labeled datasets, respectively. The exact match accuracy is 22.57% and 27.22% respectively for the original and summarized error-labeled datasets. The comprehensive experimental results of the proposed approach are promising for multi-label error classification over the baseline models. Moreover, the findings derived from the proposed approach and data-driven analytical results hold significant promise for error classification, programming education, and related research endeavors.;"[Amin, Md Faizul Ibne; Shirafuji, Atsushi; Watanobe, Yutaka] Univ Aizu, Grad Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima 9658580, Japan; [Rahman, Md Mostafizer] Dhaka Univ Engn & Technol, Informat & Commun Technol Cell, Gazipur 1707, Bangladesh";"University of Aizu; Dhaka University of Engineering & Technology (DUET)";"Amin, MFI (corresponding author), Univ Aizu, Grad Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Aizu Wakamatsu, Fukushima 9658580, Japan.;Rahman, MM (corresponding author), Dhaka Univ Engn & Technol, Informat & Commun Technol Cell, Gazipur 1707, Bangladesh.";"aminfaizul007@gmail.com; mostafiz26@gmail.com";;;;;;;66;0;0;0;0;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2024;12;;;;;;100805;100820;;10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3430558;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3430558;;;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";ZZ0T4;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001278997000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Our proposed course content discusses rendering topics, game object management, scene management, and rigid body physics where learners are tasked to incorporate them into a fully functional prototype scene editor. By incorporating actual coding into the course, students can gain a better understanding of low-level engine features and also hone their programming skills. In addition to the learning content, we provide recommended assessment methods. We include discussions about our teaching experience in handling a game engine architecture course, titled GDENG03, which 36 students have passed. Our paper stands out from related works by providing a framework for interested educators on how to write a 3D game engine and how to teach the same in class. Based on our actual delivery of GDENG03, all 36 students achieved high scores of >80% out of 100 which demonstrates the effectiveness of our learning content. We received positive student feedback, such as a better appreciation of game engines, while suggestions for course improvement were raised, such as using simpler terminologies and better workload management. Based on student scores and feedback, we can attribute the success of our students' learning to our inclusion of practical coding examples and discussions, highlighting their relevance to mainstream game engines.

However, with the growing usage of OSS components in both free and proprietary software, vulnerabilities that are present within them can be spread to a vast array of underlying applications. Even worse, a myriad of vulnerabilities are fixed secretly via patch commits, which causes other software re-using the vulnerable code snippets to be left in the dark. Thus, source code patch commit mining toward vulnerability discovery is receiving immense attention, and a variety of approaches are proposed. Despite that, there is no comprehensive survey summarizing and discussing the current progress within this field. To fill this gap, we survey, evaluate, and systematize a list of literature and provide the community with our insights on both successes and remaining issues in this space. Special attention is paid on the work toward vulnerability discovery. In this paper, we also provide an introductory panorama with our replicable hands-on experience, which can help readers quickly understand and step into the pertinent field. Our empirical study reveals noteworthy challenges which need to be highlighted and addressed in this field. We also discuss potential directions for the future work. To the best of knowledge, we provide the first literature review to study source code patch commit mining in the vulnerability discovery context. The systematic framework, hands-on practices, and list of potential challenges provide new knowledge for mining source code patch commit toward a more robust software eco-system.

This study focuses on the effectiveness of agile practices, specifically the pair programming and the test-first programming practices. Despite the importance of these functions, there exists a dearth of empirical evidence on the impact of agile practices on their development, raising questions about their potential to enhance correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper aims to bridge this gap by comparing the application of agile practices with traditional approaches in the context of auxiliary function development. We conducted six experiments involving 122 participants (85 novices and 37 professionals) who used both traditional and agile methods to develop six auxiliary functions across three different domains. Our analysis of 244 implementations suggests the potential benefits of agile practices in auxiliary function development. Pair programming showed a tendency towards improved correctness, while test-first programming did not significantly extend the total development time, particularly among professionals.

As indicated by our results, the potential benefits of agile practices may vary depending on factors such as the programmer's experience level and the nature of the functions being developed.

Models can become confused and their performance is undermined by the introduction of meticulously crafted distortions. These attacks can even infiltrate a variety of models, bringing greater security risks. To understand how it works and mitigate its effects, our research focuses on scrutinizing the transferability of adversarial attacks in the expanding context of miniature machine learning for UAVs. In this article, we introduce a formula to help measure the transferability of adversarial attacks and explore ways to improve the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial attacks (e.g., a combination of attack techniques), and provide visualizations to vividly illustrate the repercussions of adversarial instances across a spectrum of attack intensities, helping facilitate more intuitive exploration and analysis of the results. For instance, our findings demonstrate that even subtle perturbations directed at specific attributes can lead to a significant decrease in model accuracy. We also evaluate the success rates of various attack algorithms and validate the proposed evaluation methodology for measuring transferability. And the outcomes unveiled in this study make noteworthy strides in fostering a profound comprehension of the transferability of adversarial attacks in the distinct realm of miniature machine learning for UAVs. Robust defense mechanisms, which ensure the impregnability of IoT-enabled UAV systems, can be cultivated by pinpointing the most efficacious attack strategies and evaluating their transferability.;"[Zhou, Shan; Huang, Xianting; Han, Xuming] Jinan Univ, Coll Informat Sci, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] Univ Jordan, King Abdullah II Sch Informat Technol, Amman 11942, Jordan; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] SRM Univ, Sch Comp, Dept Computat Intelligence, Kattankulathur 603203, India; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] Amity Univ, Sch Engn, Noida 201301, India; [Alzahrani, Bander A.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah 21441, Saudi Arabia; [Kumari, Saru] Chaudhary Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut 250001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Chen, Chien-Ming] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing 211544, Peoples R China";"Jinan University; University of Jordan; University of Science & Technology Beijing; SRM Institute of Science & Technology Chennai; Amity University Noida; King Abdulaziz University; Chaudhary Charan Singh University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology";"Han, XM (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Coll Informat Sci, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.;Kumari, S (corresponding author), Chaudhary Charan Singh Univ, Dept Math, Meerut 250001, Uttar Pradesh, India.";"tzhoushan@jnu.edu.cn; hhhxtw02@stu2021.jnu.edu.cn; m.s.obaidat@ieee.org; Baalzahrani@kau.edu.sa; hanxuming@jnu.edu.cn; saru@ieee.org; chienmingchen@ieee.org";Chen, Chien-Ming/W-2133-2019;"Chen, Chien-Ming/0000-0002-6502-472X; Huang, Xianting/0009-0002-1375-0065; Kumari, Saru/0000-0003-4929-5383; Han, Xuming/0000-0002-6213-5600; Obaidat, Mohammad S./0000-0002-1569-9657";;;;;23;4;4;2;2;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2327-4662;;;IEEE INTERNET THINGS;IEEE Internet Things J.;JUN 15;2024;11;12;;;;;21037;21045;;10.1109/JIOT.2023.3329954;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2023.3329954;;;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";TP1C5;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001242362600013;View Full Record in Web of Science

The system's key innovation is its seamless prototyping of scientific formulations for computational problems in topology optimization. Its layered and object-oriented architecture, based on the template method design pattern, facilitates effortless modifications of algorithms and the introduction of new types of finite elements, materials, and analyses. MorphoGen also offers flexible handling of objective functions and constraints during topological optimization, enhancing its adaptability. It empowers researchers and practitioners to explore a wide range of engineering challenges, fostering a deeper understanding of complex structural behaviors and efficient design solutions. There are many topology optimization software and open source codes, especially based on the classical SIMP method. Unlike these codes our package is freely distributed among users and since it is distributed on the MIT licence, which allows for its easy modification depending on the particular needs of the users. For this purpose, we use the topology optimization algorithm proposed for the first time in our previous paper (Blachowski et al., 2020). The algorithm is based on a fully stress design-based optimality criteria and can be applied for topology optimization of either linearly elastic and elastoplastic structures. Additionally, the novelty of the proposed system is related to its ability of solving optimal topology under various constraints such as displacement, stresses and fatigue in both deterministic and probabilistic cases. Another application are modular structures, which reduce design complexity and manufacturing costs as well as rapid reconfiguration. However, in the realm of structural optimization, modular systems are more challenging due to various: modes of operation of the modules and the stresses configurations. Moreover, this area of research is dramatically less explored. Thus the effectiveness of MorphoGen for structural engineering is demonstrated with examples of topological shape optimization of two Extremely Modular Systems: a planar robotic manipulator Arm-Z and spatial free-form ramp Truss-Z.;"[Tauzowski, Piotr; Blachowski, Bartlomiej; Zawidzka, Ela; Zawidzki, Machi] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Fundamental Technol Res, Pawinskiego 5B, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland";"Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Fundamental Technological Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences";Zawidzki, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Fundamental Technol Res, Pawinskiego 5B, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland.;zawidzki@ippt.pan.pl;Zawidzki, Machi/K-8634-2015;Zawidzki, Machi/0000-0001-8695-4400;National Science Centre, Poland [2019/33/B/ST8/02791];National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland);This research is a part of the project titled Arm-Z: an extremely modular hyper redundant low-cost manipulator - development of control methods and efficiency analysis and funded by OPUS 17 research grant No. 2019/33/B/ST8/02791 supported by the National Science Centre, Poland.;;53;1;1;1;1;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2352-7110;;;SOFTWAREX;SoftwareX;SEP;2024;27;;;;;;;;101797;10.1016/j.softx.2024.101797;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101797;;JUN 2024;10;Computer Science, Software Engineering;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;XI1Q8;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001260965800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

While the performance of GPT-X architectures is there for all to see, many efforts are underway to penetrate the secrets of these black-boxes in terms of intelligent information processing whose output statistical distributions resemble that of natural language. In this work, through the complexity science framework, a comparative study of the stochastic processes underlying the texts produced by the English version of GPT-2 with respect to texts produced by human beings, notably novels in English and programming codes, is offered. The investigation, of a methodological nature, consists first of all of an analysis phase in which the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis - together with Zipf's law and approximate entropy - are adopted to characterize long-term correlations, regularities and recurrences in human and machine-produced texts. Results show several peculiarities and trends in terms of long-range correlations and recurrences in the last case. The synthesis phase, on the other hand, uses the complexity measures to build synthetic text descriptors - hence a suitable text embedding - which serve to constitute the features for feeding a machine learning system designed to operate feature selection through an evolutionary technique. Using multivariate analysis, it is then shown the grouping tendency of the three analyzed text types, allowing to place GTP-2 texts in between natural language texts and computer codes. Similarly, the classification task demonstrates that, given the high accuracy obtained in the automatic discrimination of text classes, the proposed set of complexity measures is highly informative.

It also seeks to understand the perceptions of consumers in the UAE regarding the adoption of 3D holography in educational environments. The study employs a theoretical framework that incorporates variables such as Perceived Compatibility, Observability, Trialability, Relative Advantage, Ease of Doing Business, and Technology Export. Data were collected through 828 questionnaires distributed across various educational institutions. To analyze the collected data, the study utilized a combination of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), focusing on responses from the student surveys. Additionally, Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) was employed to assess the significance and performance of various factors. What distinguises this study is its theoretical framework, which integrates individual and technological characteristics, offering a novel perspective on the subject matter. Results revealed that factors derived from diffusion theory notably surpassed those concerning the Ease of Doing Business and Technology Export in their influence on technology adoption. Notably, the J48 decision tree classifier demonstrated superior accuracy over other classifiers in predicting the value of the dependent variable.

In this paper, we observe that there is a common phenomenon of answer bias, i.e., a highly unbalanced distribution of correct and incorrect answers for each question. Existing models tend to memorize the answer bias as a shortcut for achieving high prediction performance in KT, thereby failing to fully understand students' knowledge states. To address this issue, we approach the KT task from a causality perspective. A causal graph of KT is first established, from which we identify that the impact of answer bias lies in the direct causal effect of questions on students' responses. A novel COunterfactual REasoning (CORE) framework for KT is further proposed, which separately captures the total causal effect and direct causal effect during training, and mitigates answer bias by subtracting the latter from the former in testing. The CORE framework is applicable to various existing KT models, and we implement it based on the prevailing DKT, DKVMN, and AKT models, respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE in making the debiased inference for KT.

While SM has brought positive transformations, it has also amplified pre-existing issues such as misinformation, echo chambers, manipulation, and propaganda. A thorough comprehension of this impact, aided by state-of-the-art analytical tools and by an awareness of societal biases and complexities, enables us to anticipate and mitigate the potential negative effects. One such tool is BERTopic, a novel deep-learning algorithm developed for Topic Mining, which has been shown to offer significant advantages over traditional methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), particularly in terms of its high modularity, which allows for extensive personalization at each stage of the topic modeling process. In this study, we hypothesize that BERTopic, when optimized for Twitter data, can provide a more coherent and stable topic modeling. We began by conducting a review of the literature on topic-mining approaches for short-text data. Using this knowledge, we explored the potential for optimizing BERTopic and analyzed its effectiveness. Our focus was on Twitter data spanning the two years of the 117th US Congress. We evaluated BERTopic's performance using coherence, perplexity, diversity, and stability scores, finding significant improvements over traditional methods and the default parameters for this tool. We discovered that improvements are possible in BERTopic's coherence and stability. We also identified the major topics of this Congress, which include abortion, student debt, and Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Additionally, we describe a simple application we developed for a better visualization of Congress topics.;"[Mendonca, Margarida; Figueira, Alvaro] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Figueira, Alvaro] Univ Porto, CRACS INESCTEC, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal; [Mendonca, Margarida; Figueira, Alvaro] DCC FCUP, Rua Campo Alegre S-N, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal";"Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; INESC TEC; Universidade do Porto";"Figueira, A (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Fac Sci, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal.;Figueira, A (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CRACS INESCTEC, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal.;Figueira, A (corresponding author), DCC FCUP, Rua Campo Alegre S-N, P-4169007 Porto, Portugal.";arfiguei@fc.up.pt;Figueira, Alvaro R/B-2829-2012;Figueira, Alvaro R/0000-0002-0507-7504;;;;;90;1;1;22;22;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2227-9709;;INFORMATICS-BASEL;Informatics-Basel;MAR;2024;11;1;;;;;;;8;10.3390/informatics11010008;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/informatics11010008;;;34;Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;MI6W9;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001193043100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Safe intraoperative measurement of in vivo elastic modulus of the human meniscus could contribute to a better understanding of meniscus health, and for developing surgical simulators where novice surgeons can learn to distinguish healthy from degenerative meniscus tissue. Such measurement can also support intraoperative decision-making by providing a quantitative measure of the meniscus health condition. The objective of this study is to demonstrate a method for intraoperative identification of meniscus elastic modulus during arthroscopic probing using an adaptive observer method. Methods: Ex vivo arthroscopic examinations were performed on five cadaveric knees to estimate the elastic modulus of the anterior, mid-body, and posterior regions of lateral and medial menisci. Real -time intraoperative force-displacement data was obtained and utilized for modulus estimation through an adaptive observer method. For the validation of arthroscopic elastic moduli, an inverse parameter identification approach using optimization, based on biomechanical indentation tests and finite element analyses, was employed. Experimental force-displacement data in various anatomical locations were measured through indentation. An iterative optimization algorithm was employed to optimize elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios by comparing experimental force values at maximum displacement with the corresponding force values from linear elastic region-specific finite element models. Finally, the estimated elastic modulus values obtained from ex vivo arthroscopy were compared against optimized values using a paired t -test. Results: The elastic moduli obtained from ex vivo arthroscopy and optimization showcased subject specificity in material properties. Additionally, the results emphasized anatomical and regional specificity within the menisci. The anterior region of the medial menisci exhibited the highest elastic modulus among the anatomical locations studied ( 9 . 97 +/- 3 . 20 MPa from arthroscopy and 5 . 05 +/- 1 . 97 MPa from finite element-based inverse parameter identification). The paired t -test results indicated no statistically significant difference between the elastic moduli obtained from arthroscopy and inverse parameter identification, suggesting the feasibility of stiffness estimation using arthroscopic examination. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the feasibility of intraoperative identification of patient-specific elastic modulus for meniscus tissue during arthroscopy.;"[Rasheed, Bismi; Bjelland, Oystein; Schaarschmidt, Ute; Schaathun, Hans Georg; Bye, Robin T.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept ICT & Nat Sci, Cyber Phys Syst Lab, N-6025 Alesund, Norway; [Rasheed, Bismi; Bjelland, Oystein; Dalen, Andreas F.] More & Romsdal Hosp Trust, Dept Res & Innovat, Alesund Biomech Lab, N-6017 Alesund, Norway; [Dalen, Andreas F.] More & Romsdal Hosp Trust, Dept Orthopaed Surg, N-6017 Alesund, Norway; [Pedersen, Morten D.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Engn Cybernet, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Steinert, Martin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway";"Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)";Rasheed, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept ICT & Nat Sci, Cyber Phys Syst Lab, N-6025 Alesund, Norway.;bismi.rasheed@ntnu.no;Bye, Robin T./H-3703-2011;Bye, Robin T./0000-0002-6063-1264;;;Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Department of ICT and Natural Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, angstrom lesund, 6025, Norway.;;50;0;0;0;0;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0169-2607;1872-7565;;COMPUT METH PROG BIO;Comput.

J;"Rani, P; Petrulio, F; Bacchelli, A";;;;"Rani, Pooja; Petrulio, Fernando; Bacchelli, Alberto";;;On Refining the SZZ Algorithm with Bug Discussion Data;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Software quality; Pull request; Empirical research; Taxonomy; SZZ algorithm; Bug-introducing commits; Mozilla";"PREDICTION MODELS; IMPACT";Context Researchers testing hypotheses related to factors leading to low-quality software often rely on historical data, specifically on details regarding when defects were introduced into a codebase of interest. The prevailing techniques to determine the introduction of defects revolve around variants of the SZZ algorithm. This algorithm leverages information on the lines modified during a bug-fixing commit and finds when these lines were last modified, thereby identifying bug-introducing commits. Objectives Despite several improvements and variants, SZZ struggles with accuracy, especially in cases of unrelated modifications or that touch files not involved in the introduction of the bug in the version control systems (aka tangled commit and ghost commits). Methods Our research investigates whether and how incorporating content retrieved from bug discussions can address these issues by identifying the related and external files and thus improve the efficacy of the SZZ algorithm. Results To conduct our investigation, we take advantage of the links manually inserted by Mozilla developers in bug reports to signal which commits inserted bugs. Thus, we prepared the dataset, RoTEB, comprised of 12,472 bug reports. We first manually inspect a sample of 369 bug reports related to these bug-fixing or bug-introducing commits and investigate whether the files mentioned in these reports could be useful for SZZ. After we found evidence that the mentioned files are relevant, we augment SZZ with this information, using different strategies, and evaluate the resulting approach against multiple SZZ variations. Conclusion We define a taxonomy outlining the rationale behind developers' references to diverse files in their discussions. We observe that bug discussions often mention files relevant to enhancing the SZZ algorithm's efficacy. Then, we verify that integrating these file references augments the precision of SZZ in pinpointing bug-introducing commits. Yet, it does not markedly influence recall. These results deepen our comprehension of the usefulness of bug discussions for SZZ. Future work can leverage our dataset and explore other techniques to further address the problem of tangled commits and ghost commits.;"[Rani, Pooja; Petrulio, Fernando; Bacchelli, Alberto] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland";University of Zurich;Rani, P (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland.;"rani@ifi.uzh.ch; fe.petrulio@gmail.com; bacchelli@ifi.uzh.ch";;;"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Frderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [200021_197227]; Swiss National Science Foundation for the SNF Project";"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Frderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; Swiss National Science Foundation for the SNF Project";P.

This paper investigates the ability of a Deep Learning (DL) approach to predict future disease diagnosis from Electronic Health Records (EHR) for the purposes of Population Health Management. Methods In this study, embeddings were created using a Word2Vec algorithm from structured vocabulary commonly used in EHRs e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) codes. This study is based on longitudinal medical data from similar to 50 m patients in the USA. We introduced a novel method of including binned observation values into an embeddings model. We also included novel features associated with wider determinants of health. Patient records comprising these embeddings were then fed to a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict the likelihood of patients developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), Hypertension or experiencing an Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) in the next 3 years. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to achieve model explainability. Results Increasing the data scope to include binned observations and wider determinants of health was found to improve predictive performance. We achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve value of 0.92 for Diabetes prediction, 0.94 for COPD, 0.92 for Hypertension and 0.94 for MI. The SHAP values showed that the models had learned features known to be associated with these outcomes. Discussion The DL approach outlined in this study can identify clinically-relevant features from large-scale EHR data and use these to predict future disease outcomes. This study highlights the promise of DL solutions for identifying patients at future risk of disease and providing clinicians with the means to understand and evaluate the drivers of those predictions.;"[Grout, Robert] Accenture, Leeds, England; [Gupta, Rishab] Accenture, San Francisco, CA USA; [Bryant, Ruby; Elmahgoub, Mawada A.; Li, Yijie; Irfanullah, Khushbakht; Patel, Rahul F.; Inness, Catherine] Accenture, London, England; [Fawkes, Jake] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Oxford, England";"Accenture; Accenture; University of Oxford";Grout, R (corresponding author), Accenture, Leeds, England.;robert.grout@accenture.com;;;Accenture;Accenture;The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Nevertheless, educational experiences that seek to integrate the systems approach and citizenship education are not numerous and have not been sufficiently documented. This research paper presents classroom research aimed at understanding how Systems Thinking and citizenship education are articulated within a general education course.Design/methodology/approachThe research was designed using Grounded Theory within an exploratory-descriptive approach. To collect data, the following techniques were used: participant observation, focus group and documentary analysis. The data analysis was carried out through the constant comparative method in its open, axial, selective and theoretical contrast coding phases.FindingsThe data analysis highlights the potential of Systems Thinking within the context of Citizenship Education as a comprehensive set of cognitive, affective and methodological tools. Moreover, it sheds light on the pedagogical practices, the teaching strategies and the type of socioemotional interactions in the classroom that are key elements in promoting citizenship attitudes, ideas and behaviors.Originality/valueThe research underscores the importance of a systemic vision of education that explicitly incorporates social-emotional learning and experiences of citizen participation beyond the classroom where students can build new knowledge from first-hand interactions with processes of social transformation.;"[Martinez, Andres Felipe Astaiza; Leon, Gina Alexandra Rojas] Univ Ibague, Unidad Proyectos Especiales, Ibague, Colombia";;Martínez, AFA (corresponding author), Univ Ibague, Unidad Proyectos Especiales, Ibague, Colombia.;andres.astaiza@unibague.edu.co;;;;;;;83;0;0;0;0;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;Leeds;Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0368-492X;1758-7883;;KYBERNETES;Kybernetes;2024 AUG 14;2024;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/K-09-2023-1756;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-09-2023-1756;;AUG 2024;18;Computer Science, Cybernetics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;C4L2Z;;;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001289085700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Current software defect prediction approaches rely on manually crafted features such as change metrics and involve expensive to train machine learning or deep learning models. These models typically involve extensive training processes that may require significant computational resources and time. These characteristics can pose challenges when attempting to update the models in real-time as new examples become available, potentially impacting their suitability for fast online defect prediction. Furthermore, the reliance on a complex underlying model makes these approaches often less explainable, which means the developers cannot understand the reasons behind models' predictions. An approach that is not explainable might not be adopted in real-life development environments because of developers' lack of trust in its results. To address these limitations, we propose an approach called IRJIT that employs information retrieval on source code and labels new commits as buggy or clean based on their similarity to past buggy or clean commits. IRJIT approach is online and explainable as it can learn from new data without expensive retraining, and developers can see the documents that support a prediction, providing additional context. By evaluating 10 open-source datasets in a within project setting, we show that our approach is up to 112 times faster than the state-of-the-art ML and DL approaches, offers explainability at the commit and line level, and has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art.;"[Sahar, Hareem; Hindle, Abram] Univ Alberta, Dept Comp Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Bangash, Abdul Ali] Queens Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kingston, ON, Canada";"University of Alberta; Queens University - Canada";Sahar, H (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Comp Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.;"hareeme@ualberta.ca; abdulali.b@queensu.ca; abram.hindle@ualberta.ca; denilson@ualberta.ca";;;;;DAS:The dataset used in evaluation, the source code to evaluate approaches and the R scripts to plot the graphs for this study are available at: https://github.com/Hareem-E-Sahar/eseval_online;;48;0;0;1;1;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in automated vulnerability detection. However, it is difficult for deep learning models to understand the semantics and domain-specific knowledge of source code. In this study, we introduce a new vulnerability detection framework, ProRLearn, which leverages two main techniques: prompt tuning and reinforcement learning. Since existing fine-tuning of pre-trained language models (PLMs) struggles to leverage domain knowledge fully, we introduce a new automatic prompt-tuning technique. Precisely, prompt tuning mimics the pre-training process of PLMs by rephrasing task input and adding prompts, using the PLM's output as the prediction output. The introduction of the reinforcement learning reward mechanism aims to guide the behavior of vulnerability detection through a reward and punishment model, enabling it to learn effective strategies for obtaining maximum long-term rewards in specific environments. The introduction of reinforcement learning aims to encourage the model to learn how to maximize rewards or minimize penalties, thus enhancing performance. Experiments on three datasets (FFMPeg+Qemu, Reveal, and Big-Vul) indicate that ProRLearn achieves performance improvement of 3.27-70.96% over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of F1 score. The combination of prompt tuning and reinforcement learning can offer a potential opportunity to improve performance in vulnerability detection. This means that it can effectively improve the performance in responding to constantly changing network environments and new threats. This interdisciplinary approach contributes to a better understanding of the interplay between natural language processing and reinforcement learning, opening up new opportunities and challenges for future research and applications.;"[Ren, Zilong; Ju, Xiaolin; Chen, Xiang; Shen, Hao] Nantong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Nantong 226019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China";Nantong University;"Ju, XL; Chen, X (corresponding author), Nantong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Nantong 226019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.";"zilongren23@gmail.com; ju.xl@ntu.edu.cn; xchencs@ntu.edu.cn; shenhyc@gmail.com";;;;;;;63;0;0;10;10;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0928-8910;1573-7535;;AUTOMAT SOFTW ENG;Automat.

CryptoLin was human-annotated with discrete values representing negative, neutral, and positive news respectively. Eighty-three people participated in the annotation process; each news title was randomly assigned and blindly annotated by three human annotators, one in each different cohort, followed by a consensus mechanism using simple voting. The selection of the annotators was intentionally made using three cohorts with students from a very diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds to minimize bias as much as possible. In case one of the annotators was in total disagreement with the other two (e.g., one negative vs two positive or one positive vs two negative), we considered this minority report and defaulted the labeling to neutral. Fleiss's Kappa, Krippendorff's Alpha, and Gwet's AC1 inter-rater reliability coefficients demonstrate CryptoLin's acceptable quality of inter-annotator agreement. The dataset also includes a text span with the three manual label annotations for further auditing of the annotation mechanism. To further assess the quality of the labeling and the usefulness of CryptoLin dataset, it incorporates four pretrained Sentiment Analysis models: Vader, Textblob, Flair, and FinBERT. Vader and FinBERT demonstrate reasonable performance in the CryptoLin dataset, indicating that the data was not annotated randomly and is therefore useful for further research1. FinBERT (negative) presents the best performance, indicating an advantage of being trained with financial news. Both the CryptoLin dataset and the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis, for reproducibility, are available at the project's Github. Overall, CryptoLin aims to complement the current knowledge by providing a novel and publicly available Gadi and & Aacute;ngel Sicilia (Cryptolin dataset and python jupyter notebooks reproducibility codes, 2022) cryptocurrency sentiment corpus and fostering research on the topic of cryptocurrency sentiment analysis and potential applications in behavioral science. This can be useful for businesses and policymakers who want to understand how cryptocurrencies are being used and how they might be regulated.

The Q-learning algorithm is introduced and a deep Q network is implemented to introduce the use of neural networks in deep RL. The software is user-friendly and allows easy modification of learning parameters, reward functions, and algorithms. The approach was tested successfully on a Franka Emika Panda robot, where the robot manipulator learned to move to a randomly generated target position, shoot a real ball into the goal, and push various objects into target position.

As a first such study of public institutions, our analyses are primarily macroscopic in nature, observing patterns in the overall course prerequisite networks (CPNs) and Curriculum Graphs (CGs). An overarching objective is to better understand CPN variability and patterns across different institutions and how these patterns relate to curricular outcomes. In addition to computing well known network centrality measures to capture courses of importance in the CPNs studied, we have also formulated some newer methods with specific relevance to the curricular domains and corresponding graph types at hand. We have discovered that a new graph theoretic measure of node importance which we call reach, based on the well-known concept of reachability, is needed to more accurately express the critical nature of some introductory courses in a university. Another analytical novelty that we introduce and apply to the subject of CPNs is the Longest Paths Induced sub-Graph (LPIG) of the CPN, which yields information on relatively constrained programs and pathways. Finally, we have established a new connection between clustering of the CG and meta-majors at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE), providing clusterings of the other public institution CGs as useful heuristics of major groupings as well.

However, current methodologies employed in quantum computing often require, among other things, a broad understanding of quantum hardware and low-level programming languages, posing challenges to software developers in effectively creating and implementing quantum services. This study advocates the adoption of software engineering principles in quantum computing, thereby establishing a higher level of hardware abstraction that allows developers to focus on application development. With this proposal, developers can design and deploy quantum services with less effort, which is similar to the facilitation provided by service-oriented computing for the development of conventional software services. This study introduces a continuous deployment strategy adapted to the development of quantum services that covers the creation and deployment of such services. For this purpose, an extension of the OpenAPI specification is proposed, which allows the generation of services that implement quantum algorithms.

Recent advancements in technology have facilitated the development of sophisticated methods to assess and predict physical activity outcomes, making their evaluation increasingly critical. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop a reliable assessment model for smart wearable devices used in college students' sports activities. The objective is to accurately predict and evaluate the effectiveness of these devices in improving students' physical health and promoting lifelong sports habits. Ultimately, the research seeks to integrate advanced computational methods to enhance the accuracy of physical exercise assessments. METHODS: The research introduces a novel assessment model that combines a zebra behavior-based heuristic optimization algorithm with a convolutional neural network (CNN). By analyzing user behavior data from wearable devices, the model constructs an evaluation index system tailored for college sports activities. The approach optimizes the parameters of the CNN using the zebra optimization algorithm, ensuring enhanced prediction accuracy. RESULTS: The evaluation model demonstrated high accuracy, with a significant improvement in predicting the outcomes of physical exercises among college students. Comparative analyses with traditional methods revealed that the new model reduced prediction errors and increased real -time performance metrics. Specifically, the model achieved a lower root mean square error (RMSE) in simulation tests, indicating more precise assessments.

J;Kaplan, YA;;;;Kaplan, Yusuf Alper;;;Forecasting of global solar radiation: A statistical approach using simulated annealing algorithm;ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Solar radiation; Simulated annealing algorithm; Model developing; Statistical tests";"MACHINE LEARNING-MODELS; SUNSHINE DURATION; PART 2; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM";In recent years, the share of renewable energy sources in current energy production has been increasing due to the depletion of fossil fuel resources, increasing energy needs and environmental concerns. Solar energy, one of the most important renewable energy sources depending on being clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source. Understanding the solar radiation value is crucial for maximizing the potential of solar energy and ensuring the efficient operation of solar energy systems. In this paper, it is aimed to develop a new global solar radiation (GSR) prediction model by using simulated annealing algorithm (SAA). Modeling solar radiation data with significant variability is a challenging task that necessitates the use of nonlinear approaches. Although the SAA is widely used in engineering and natural sciences, it has not previously been used to develop a GSR prediction model. While developing the SAA forecast model for the Adana region, long-term sunshine duration and solar radiation data obtained from the Turkish General Directorate of State Meteorology were used, as well as geographical features such as latitude and longitude of the selected region. The performance and applicability of the proposed model was examined by comparing it with different GSR estimation methods developed in the literature. The primary contribution of this study lies in the introduction of an inventive model, which has been constructed for the first time in the assessment of GSR, to the current collection of literature. The produced results were statistically compared with the observed data using six separate performance and error measures. The results of all years showed that the relative percentage error (RPE) less than 11.66 %, the mean percentage error (MPE) does not exceed 12.55 %, the correlation coefficient (R2) greater than 0.98, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) test results appear to vary close to the value 10, the sum of squared relative error (SSRE) test results seem to approaching 0 and the t-statistic test less than 4.06 for the annual GSR. It has been observed that the developed SAA GSR forecasting model has a successful performance when compared to different forecasting models popularly used in the literature. According to the statistical error results, the estimated GSR data from the novel SAA-GSR forecast model aligns well with the measured meteorological values. Given the efficacy of the established SAA model in GSR estimation, this study is anticipated to offer valuable insights and contributions to the application of the SAA approach in other energy applications.;[Kaplan, Yusuf Alper] Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Dept Energy Syst Engn, TR-80000 Osmaniye, Turkiye;Osmaniye Korkut Ata University;Kaplan, YA (corresponding author), Osmaniye Korkut Ata Univ, Dept Energy Syst Engn, TR-80000 Osmaniye, Turkiye.;alperkaplan@osmaniye.edu.tr;;;;;;;39;0;0;0;0;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0952-1976;1873-6769;;ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL;Eng.

However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students' cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.;"[Kong, Siu-Cheung] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yi-Qing] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Artificial Intelligence & Digital Competency Educ, Fac Educ, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";"Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)";Kong, SC (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;"sckong@eduhk.hk; yiqing@eduhk.hk";;Kong, Siu-Cheung/0000-0002-8691-3016;Coolthink@JC project from Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust;Coolthink@JC project from Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust;The authors would like to acknowledge the funding support of this Coolthink@JC project from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust.;;67;0;0;0;0;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

This article presents a novel discipline-based framework designed to integrate advanced computational skills into engineering education. Responding to challenges such as the disconnection between computational abilities and domain-specific knowledge, and student demotivation due to overwhelming technological challenges, this study aims to validate the impact of the framework on domain learning, computational skill acquisition, and perceived future utility. Implementing a case study approach, we explore the development of high-performance computing skills within a project-based learning context in Civil Engineering. Results indicate significant improvements in students' understanding of both computational concepts and the engineering domain, evidenced by enhanced self-perception and positive Technology Acceptance Model outcomes. The framework facilitated a meaningful connection between computational skills and professional applications, as seen in students' project reflections. Despite the promising results, the necessity for instructors to possess and impart computational knowledge is highlighted as an important factor for successful integration. This study contributes to educational computing research by providing a scalable approach to embedding advanced computational skills in engineering curricula, addressing existing educational challenges, and suggesting directions for future research.;"[Abell, Jose A.; Moreno-Casas, Patricio A.; Recabarren, Matias] Univ Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile";Universidad de los Andes - Chile;Recabarren, M (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile.;mrecabarren@miuandes.cl;;;Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID), FONDECYT Iniciacion [11220530];Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID), FONDECYT Iniciacion;Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID), FONDECYT Iniciacion, Grant/Award Number: project No. 11220530;;29;0;0;1;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Using a sample of Iranian high school students (N = 366), we employ OLS and SEM to test whether and how TRDM, perceived deterrence, and prior victimization influence the most common forms of online harassment: cyberbullying and cyberstalking. Findings demonstrate cyberbullying and cyberstalking victimization increase engagement in offending behavior while participants' fear of sanction reduces engagement in both cyberbullying and cyberstalking perpetration. Notably, results demonstrate that TRDM has a direct, mediating, and moderating effect on both forms of offending. TRDM also has an indirect effect on cyberbullying and cyberstalking perpetration through victimization and participants' perceptions of sanction. Unlike contemporary, pre-dispositional theories of crime, TRDM is dynamic and can be improved via educational programming. We posit that current cyber hygiene campaigns should include elements aimed to improve individuals' cognitive decision-making capabilities. Guided by theory, and based on the results of the current study, this translational approach could prevent victimization while simultaneously improving other elements of the participants' life.;"[Howell, C.

Social robots can interact with students and provide personalized learning support, thereby improving their learning effectiveness and engagement. The speech sensing model of social robots can perceive students' emotions and feedback in real-time through technologies such as speech recognition and sentiment analysis, thereby providing intelligent responses and guidance. The deep learning recommendation model for music course resources extracts music features through deep learning techniques, and combines session interest extraction techniques to personalized recommend music resources suitable for students' interests and abilities. By analyzing students' interests and learning goals, robots can provide music learning resources that meet their needs based on recommendation algorithms, further stimulating their learning interest and enthusiasm. The experimental results show that the use of social robots in the learning environment significantly improves the learning effectiveness and participation of students. Through personalized interaction and intelligent response guidance, students are more likely to understand and master music knowledge, while experiencing joyful and positive learning emotions.

Specially in the case of students it's become very crucial and they suffer from various kind of mental disorders due to educational, emotional and societal pressure. This paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence enabled cognitive computer-centered digital analysis model for the examination of children's mental health. The objective of children mental health analysis using vocal spectrogram, a pseudo-scientific technology, is to deduce deceit from mental health that is detected in the voice. With excessive stress being viewed as an indication of deceit, the technology seeks to distinguish between good mental health and bad mental health outputs in response to stimuli. In this study, we provide a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) based cognitive computer-based model for detecting children mental health based on speech cues and deep learning. Automatic children mental health detection is developing into an intriguing study topic since communication between intelligent systems and humans is demanded to happen more frequently. Although the level of particular hormones, like as cortisol, can be accurately measured to identify children's mental health. Proposed CNN model validation is done using five different usability factors (learnability, efficiency, effectiveness, satisfaction and understandability) to assess its utility and effectiveness and the results of the initial tests indicate that the proposed model provides a promis- ing tool for the examination of children's mental health. This paper also discusses how Reinforcement Learning (RL) and CNN algorithms can be used for continuous improvement of the proposed model.;"[Agarwal, Jyoti; Sharma, Sachin] Graphic Era Deemed Be Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India";Graphic Era University;Agarwal, J (corresponding author), Graphic Era Deemed Be Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India.;"itsjyotiagarwal1@gmail.com; sachin.cse@geu.ac.in";;;;;;;30;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1864-5909;1864-5917;;EVOL INTELL;Evol.

However, many academic programs treat CFD tools as a black box in which users simply enter data without fully understanding the inner workings of the software or its application in real-world situations. Therefore, in the context of a civil engineering program in Chile, a novel approach combining problem-based learning (PBL) with CFD was introduced into the curriculum of a fluid mechanics course to foster crucial competencies. This comprehensive methodology allows students to acquire fundamental theoretical knowledge that is directly related to specific problems in the classroom. Subsequently, students measure relevant variables in the laboratory, ultimately using these data to build computational models for comparing and contrasting reality with simulations. To gauge the effectiveness and impact of this PBL strategy, both quantitative analysis of student performance and qualitative analysis through surveys were conducted. The results reveal a significant improvement in student performance with the implementation of the PBL methodology, alongside a positive perception among students regarding its implementation. This underscores its benefits for learning, motivation, and academic performance. Additionally, the implementation of PBL was found to enhance both theoretical and practical understanding of concepts related to fluid dynamics and CFD simulation.;"[Mora-Melia, Daniel] Univ Talca, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn & Gest Construcc, Camino Los Niches Km 1, Curico 3340000, Chile; [Gutierrez-Bahamondes, Jimmy H.] Univ Talca, Fac Ingn, Dept Ciencias Comp, Curico, Chile; [Iglesias-Rey, Pedro L.; Martinez-Solano, Francisco Javier] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Ingn Hidraul & Medio Ambiente, Valencia, Spain";"Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Talca; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia";Mora-Melia, D (corresponding author), Univ Talca, Fac Ingn, Dept Ingn & Gest Construcc, Camino Los Niches Km 1, Curico 3340000, Chile.;damora@utalca.cl;;;Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo;Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo;Agencia Nacional de Investigacion y Desarrollo.;;45;0;0;3;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

Thanks to developments in deep neural networks, this technology can now account for environmental, social, and cultural factors, as well as facial expressions. We aim to create more empathetic systems for various purposes, from medicine to interpreting emotional interactions on social media.Methods To develop this technology, we combined authentic images from various databases, including EMOTIC (ADE20K, MSCOCO), EMODB_SMALL, and FRAMESDB, to train our models. We developed two sophisticated algorithms based on deep learning techniques, DCNN and VGG19. By optimizing the hyperparameters of our models, we analyze context and body language to improve our understanding of human emotions in images. We merge the 26 discrete emotional categories with the three continuous emotional dimensions to identify emotions in context. The proposed pipeline is completed by fusing our models.Results We adjusted the parameters to outperform previous methods in capturing various emotions in different contexts. Our study showed that the Sentiment_recognition_model and VGG19_contexte increased mAP by 42.81% and 44.12%, respectively, surpassing the results of previous studies.Discussion This groundbreaking research could significantly improve contextual emotion recognition in images.

However, the classroom behavior (CB) of online teaching is complex and variable, and relying on traditional classroom supervision methods, teachers find it difficult to comprehensively pay attention to the learning behavior of each student. In this regard, a dual stream network was designed to capture and analyze CB by integrating AlphaPose human keypoint detection method and image data method. The experimental results show that when the learning rate of the model parameters is set to 0.001, the accuracy of the model is as high as 92.3%. When the batch size is 8, the accuracy of the model is as high as 90.8%. The accuracy of the fusion model in capturing upright sitting behavior reached 97.3%, but the accuracy in capturing hand raising behavior decreased to only 74.8%. The fusion model performs well in terms of accuracy and recall, with recall rates of 88.3, 86.2, and 85.1% for capturing standing up, raising hands, and sitting upright behaviors, respectively. And the maximum F1 value is 0.931. The dual stream network effectively integrates the advantages of two types of data, improves the performance of behavior capture, and improves the robustness of the algorithm. The successful application of the model is beneficial for teachers' classroom observation and research activities, providing a favorable path for their professional development, and thereby improving the overall teaching quality of teachers.;[Yang, Liu] Hebei Univ Architecture, Dept Foreign Languages, Zhangjiakou 075000, Peoples R China;Hebei University of Architecture;Yang, L (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Architecture, Dept Foreign Languages, Zhangjiakou 075000, Peoples R China.;yl1541@hebiace.edu.cn;;;Hebei Provincial Department of Science and Technology [20557604k];Hebei Provincial Department of Science and Technology;The research is supported by in 2021, Hebei Provincial Department of Science and Technology supported the project: I'm coming for the Winter Olympics of Science and Technology popular science book creation.

This article aims to develop an English vocabulary learning recommendation system based on decision tree algorithm and naive Bayesian algorithm to provide personalized learning suggestions and help learners learn and remember words more effectively. Firstly, a large amount of English vocabulary data was collected, preprocessed, and feature extracted. Decision tree algorithms were selected as the foundation, and through analysis of existing data, a decision tree was generated to classify new data. Using learners' characteristics (such as age, learning objectives, etc.) and learning history (such as learned words, learning time, etc.) as inputs, a personalized recommendation model was constructed, This model can recommend suitable learning content for learners based on their personalized needs and learning situation. In order to better understand learners' learning progress, a naive Bayesian model was trained using learners' learning history and progress information to analyze their current learning progress and predict their future learning situation. Through testing and evaluation of actual learners, the recommendation system performs well in providing personalized learning suggestions, and has a significant improvement effect on learners' vocabulary learning.;[Xi, Wang] Changzhou Vocat Inst Mechatron Technol, Changzhou 213164, Jiangsu, Peoples R China;Changzhou Vocational Institute of Mechatronic Technology;Xi, W (corresponding author), Changzhou Vocat Inst Mechatron Technol, Changzhou 213164, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;18151221919@163.com;wang, zhiqiang/J-9816-2014;wang, zhiqiang/0000-0002-0945-491X;General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Higher Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province;General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Higher Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province;The paper is supported by General Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Higher Education Institutions in Jiangsu Province in 2024: Research on the Construction of General Education Curriculum System in Vocational Colleges from the Perspective of Modern Vocational Education System Construction;;17;0;0;3;3;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;London;125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND;1875-9521;1875-953X;;ENTERTAIN COMPUT;Entertain.

In particular, we focus on the Universidad Cat & oacute;lica del Norte computing engineering programs in Chile, specifically the Computing and Informatics Civil Engineering (ICCI) and Computing and Informatics Execution Engineering (IECI) programs. We developed a machine-learning-based model using random forests to predict delays in submissions of the final report of graduation projects, the key step in the graduation pipeline of the analyzed students. We had access to a data set comprised of 209 students in the period from 2013 to 2017, out of these students, only 111 completed all their graduation requirements. Thus, we focused on this subset of students for the analysis. Our analyses of results indicate that individual advisors minimally contribute to predicting timely or late submissions, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach. In contrast, the specific major, graduation modality, and time in the program play crucial roles, with GPA emerging as the most influential factor (24.06%). Notably, the Professional Work modality exhibits a moderate positive correlation with late submissions, contextualized by students' employment commitments.

These concepts that are not visible physically in real life can be challenging for students to understand, especially when it involves complex charge distributions. This paper presents a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) to visualise the concept of Coulomb's law and Gauss's law as well as a serious snake game to reinforce users' knowledge. This MATLAB GUI features a diverse range of 3-dimensional (3D) visualisations illustrating electric field attributes such as electric force, charge distribution and electric flux. These visualisations dynamically adapt to user-defined parameters, offering a rich and varied exploration of the electric field's characteristics without confining the scope to a specific count of models. In Coulomb's law section, the GUI plots the electric forces in 3-D for dipole, three-point charges, and unlimited charge. The Gauss's law section consists of windows for illustration of the fundamentals of Gauss's law for the electric field, and the illustration for the application of Gauss's law in finding the electric field for a point charge, infinite line charge and infinite plane charge. The serious snake game developed in this work allows students to engage in quizzes related to Coulomb's law and Gauss's law to serve as a tool for reinforcing their learning outcomes. The MATLAB-based GUI was chosen as the platform due to its excellent visualisation capabilities, ease of programming and capability to act as a powerful tool to enhance the learning of Coulomb's law and Gauss's law for students.;"[Tan, Xin Yi; Chan, Kheong Sann; Lim, Soo Yong] Univ Nottingham, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Selangor, Malaysia; [Lim, Soo Yong] Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia";University of Nottingham Malaysia;Lim, SY (corresponding author), Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia.;Grace.Lim@nottingham.edu.my;;Lim, Soo Yong/0000-0002-6323-9903;;;;;23;0;0;2;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

J;Zhang, H;;;;Zhang, Hong;;;A novel student achievement prediction model based on bagging-CART machine learning algorithm;CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"association rules; bagging algorithm; CART algorithm; prediction; student achievement analysis";;The learning effect of students is crucial for assessing teaching quality, thus playing a significant role in teaching management. Predicting student achievement is a major challenge in understanding the learning effect of students. Currently, many studies have utilized machine learning methods such as the decision tree algorithms C4.5, ID3, CART, J48, random forest, and others. However, few studies have explored the use of the Bagging algorithm in this field. Therefore, this study proposes a classification prediction method for student achievement based on the Bagging-CART algorithm. Initially, the student achievement data is preprocessed, and the Apriori method is applied to mine the strongly associated dataset. The optimal hyper-parameters are determined through grid search to train and predict the Bagging-CART algorithm. Furthermore, the CART, J48, and Bagging-CART algorithms are trained, and their evaluation indicators are compared using a confusion matrix. The results indicate that the Bagging-CART model achieves an accuracy of 98.16%, a recall rate of 91.80%, a precision of 90.83%, and an F1 score of 94.87%. In comparison, the accuracy, precision, and F1 scores are higher than those obtained with CART and J48. Although the recall rate is slightly lower than that of CART by 0.26%, it is 0.52% higher than that of J48. Consequently, this method demonstrates strong predictive capabilities and introduces a new reference method for evaluating students' learning effect.;"[Zhang, Hong] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Law, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hong] Fujian Normal Univ, Qishan Campus,18 Wulongjiangzhong Ave, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China";"Fujian Normal University; Fujian Normal University";Zhang, H (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Qishan Campus,18 Wulongjiangzhong Ave, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.;zh0803@fjnu.edu.cn;;;;;;;20;0;0;3;3;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1532-0626;1532-0634;;CONCURR COMP-PRACT E;Concurr.

Muscle synergies provide a simple yet quantitative framework for analyzing the hierarchical and modular architecture of the human motor system. However, to gain insights on the functional role of muscle synergies, they should be related to the task space. The recently introduced mixed -matrix factorization (MMF) algorithm extends the standard approach for synergy extraction based on non -negative matrix factorization (NMF) allowing to factorize data constituted by a mixture of non -negative variables (e.g. EMGs) and unconstrained variables (e.g. kinematics, naturally including both positive and negative values). The kinematic -muscular synergies identified by MMF provide a direct link between muscle synergies and the task space . In this contribution, we support the adoption of MMF through a Matlab toolbox for the extraction of kinematic -muscular synergies and a set of practical guidelines to allow biomedical researchers and clinicians to exploit the potential of this novel approach. Methods: MMF is implemented in the SynergyAnalyzer toolbox using an object -oriented approach. In addition to the MMF algorithm, the toolbox includes standard methods for synergy extraction (NMF and PCA), as well as methods for pre-processing EMG and kinematic data, and for plotting data and synergies. Results: As an example of MMF application, kinematic -muscular synergies were extracted from EMG and kinematic data collected during reaching movements towards 8 targets on the sagittal plane. Instructions and command lines to achieve such results are illustrated in detail. The toolbox has been released as an open -source software on GitHub under the GNU General Public License. Conclusions: Thanks to its ease of use and adaptability to a variety of datasets, SynergyAnalyzer will facilitate the adoption of MMF to extract kinematic -muscular synergies from mixed EMG and kinematic data, a useful approach in biomedical research to better understand and characterize the functional role of muscle synergies.;"[Russo, Marta; d'Avella, Andrea] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Lab Neuromotor Physiol, Rome, Italy; [Russo, Marta] Fdn Policlin Tor Vergata, Dept Neurol, Rome, Italy; [Scano, Alessandro; Brambilla, Cristina] Italian Council Natl Res CNR, Inst Intelligent Ind Syst & Technol Adv Mfg STIIMA, Via A Corti 12, Milan, Italy; [d'Avella, Andrea] Univ Messina, Dept Biomed & Dent Sci & Morphofunct Imaging, Messina, Italy; [Russo, Marta] Italian Council Natl Res CNR, Inst Cognit Sci & Technol ISTC, Rome, Italy; [d'Avella, Andrea] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biol, Rome, Italy";"IRCCS Santa Lucia; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Messina; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione (ISTC-CNR); University of Rome Tor Vergata";Scano, A (corresponding author), Italian Council Natl Res CNR, Inst Intelligent Ind Syst & Technol Adv Mfg STIIMA, Via A Corti 12, Milan, Italy.;alessandro.scano@stiima.cnr.it;"Brambilla, Cristina/KUD-5515-2024; d'Avella, Andrea/K-6856-2018";"d'Avella, Andrea/0000-0002-3393-4956; Scano, Alessandro/0000-0002-1896-9325; BRAMBILLA, CRISTINA/0000-0002-3201-8315";"Italian Ministry of Research [PNC0000007]; Italian Ministry of Health [SG-2018-12366101-RF 2018]";"Italian Ministry of Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Italian Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Italy)";This work was supported in part by the Italian Ministry of Research, under the complementary actions to the Plan of National Recovery and Resilience (PNRR) Fit4MedRob-Fit for Medical Robotics Grant (# PNC0000007) , and in part by the Starting Grant of the Italian Ministry of Health SG-2018-12366101-RF 2018.;;43;1;1;6;6;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;0169-2607;1872-7565;;COMPUT METH PROG BIO;Comput.

J;Yan, Y;;;;Yan, Yan;;;Improve robustness of machine learning via efficient optimization and conformal prediction;AI MAGAZINE;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;The advance of machine learning (ML) systems in real-world scenarios usually expects safe deployment in high-stake applications (e.g., medical diagnosis) for critical decision-making process. To this end, provable robustness of ML is usually required to measure and understand how reliable the deployed ML system is and how trustworthy their predictions can be. Many studies have been done to enhance the robustness in recent years from different angles, such as variance-regularized robust objective functions and conformal prediction (CP) for uncertainty quantification on testing data. Although these tools provably improve the robustness of ML model, there is still an inevitable gap to integrate them into an end-to-end deployment. For example, robust objectives usually require carefully designed optimization algorithms, while CP treats ML models as black boxes. This paper is a brief introduction to our recent research focusing on filling this gap. Specifically, for learning robust objectives, we designed sample-efficient stochastic optimization algorithms that achieves the optimal (or faster compared to existing algorithms) convergence rates. Moreover, for CP-based uncertainty quantification, we established a framework to analyze the expected prediction set size (smaller size means more efficiency) of CP methods in both standard and adversarial settings. This paper elaborates the key challenges and our exploration towards efficient algorithms with details of background methods, notions for robustness measure, concepts of algorithmic efficiency, our proposed algorithms and results. All of them further motivate our future research on risk-aware ML that can be critical for AI-human collaborative systems. The future work mainly targets designing conformal robust objectives and their efficient optimization algorithms.;[Yan, Yan] Washington State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 355 NE Spokane St, Pullman, WA 99163 USA;Washington State University;Yan, Y (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 355 NE Spokane St, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.;yan.yan1@wsu.edu;;;;;;;43;0;0;3;3;AMER ASSOC ARTIFICIAL INTELL;MENLO PK;445 BURGESS DRIVE, MENLO PK, CA 94025-3496 USA;0738-4602;2371-9621;;AI MAG;AI Mag.;JUN;2024;45;2;;;SI;;270;279;;10.1002/aaai.12173;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aaai.12173;;MAY 2024;10;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;US6A3;;hybrid;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001218070300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This research analyzes the beliefs and opinions of university engineering students about the gender gap in their professional fields by means of a community detection algorithm to identify groups of students with similar belief patterns. This study leverages a community detection algorithm to analyze the beliefs of 590 engineering students regarding the gender gap in their field, together with a correlational and explanatory design using a quantitative paradigm. A validated questionnaire focusing on the professional dimension was used. The algorithm identified three student communities, two gender-sensitive and one gender-insensitive. The study uncovered a concerning lack of awareness regarding the gender gap among engineering students. Many participants did not recognize the importance of increasing the representation of professional women, maintained the belief that the gender gap affects only women, and assumed that men and women are equally paid. However, women show a higher level of awareness, while men perceive the gender gap as a passing trend, which is worrying. Students recognize the importance of integrating a gender perspective into university and engineering curricula. It is worrying that many students doubt the existence of the gender gap and that both genders lack knowledge about gender gap issues. Finally, community detection algorithms could efficiently and automatically analyze gender gap issues or other unrelated topics.;"[Merayo, Noemi] Univ Valladolid, Sch Telecommun Engn, Dept Signal & Commun Theory & Telematics Engn, Valladolid 47011, Spain; [Ayuso, Alba] Univ Valladolid, Fac Med, Dept Pedag, Valladolid, Spain";"Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid";Merayo, N (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Sch Telecommun Engn, Dept Signal & Commun Theory & Telematics Engn, Valladolid 47011, Spain.;noemer@uva.es;"Ayuso-Lanchares, Alba/HGE-4599-2022; Merayo, Noemi/L-5241-2014";"Ayuso-Lanchares, Alba/0000-0002-0740-7212; Merayo, Noemi/0000-0002-6920-0778";"Universidad de Valladolid [2019-2021]; University of Valladolid as a Teaching Innovation Project InGenias: Women as a Precursor to Technological and Scientific Vocations";"Universidad de Valladolid; University of Valladolid as a Teaching Innovation Project InGenias: Women as a Precursor to Technological and Scientific Vocations";This work has been supported by the University of Valladolid as a Teaching Innovation Project InGenias: Women as a Precursor to Technological and Scientific Vocations (2019-2021).

In the system, the DTWA Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm was used to accurately compare a practitioner's complex body movements with the Tai Chi standard movements dataset, taking into account execution speed deviations and others. Meanwhile, the SVM was employed to classify the movement as to quality and correctness, thereby being able to provide precise, individual feedback. This hybrid approach ensures a high -motion recognition accuracy rate while also adhering to nuanced Tai Chi requirements. The system was evaluated through detailed testing with various levels of Tai Chi experience. Evaluation showed that the students' performance and understanding of most Taijiquan movements and related physical exercises improved significantly. It indicates the system has a practical application value for also beginners and intermediate and last expert, respectively. It also shows the effectiveness of combining DTW and SVM to support learners 'body movement trajectory in a physical learning environment, opening them up to additional technology -assisted physical training applications. This provides implications for a more promising generation of future physical education involving the incorporation of complex AI technology.;[Guo, Yujie] North China Univ Technol, Sci Coll, Phys Educ Dept, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China;North China University of Technology;Guo, YJ (corresponding author), North China Univ Technol, Sci Coll, Phys Educ Dept, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China.;G1yujie@163.com;;;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;INST COMPUTER SCIENCES, SOCIAL INFORMATICS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENG-ICST;GHENT;BEGIJNHOFLAAN 93, GHENT, 90000, BELGIUM;2032-9407;;;EAI ENDORSED TRANS S;EAI Endorsed Trans.

Moreover, the model's interpretability diminishes as the ensemble's complexity increases, presenting challenges in understanding the decision-making process. Although various pruning techniques have been proposed by researchers to tackle these issues, achieving a consensus on the optimal strategy across diverse datasets remains elusive. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative machine learning algorithm that integrates random forest with Na & iuml;ve Bayes to predict student performance. The proposed method employs the Na & iuml;ve Bayes formula to evaluate random forest branches, classifying data by prioritizing branches based on importance and assigning each example to a single branch for classification.

This limitation prevents them from meeting the essential requirements of reliability and ethical-legal considerations in practical applications. In contrast, intrinsically interpretable models, such as decision trees, possess self-evident interpretability while typically sacrificing accuracy. To effectively combine the respective advantages of both deep learning and intrinsically interpretable models, an MEG transfer approach through feature attribution-based knowledge distillation is pioneered, which transforms deep models (teacher) into highly accurate intrinsically interpretable models (student). The resulting models provide not only intrinsic interpretability but also high predictive performance, besides serving as an excellent approximate proxy to understand the inner workings of deep models. In the proposed approach, post-hoc feature knowledge derived from post-hoc interpretable algorithms, specifically feature attribution maps, is introduced into knowledge distillation for the first time. By guiding intrinsically interpretable models to assimilate this knowledge, the transfer of MEG decoding information from deep models to intrinsically interpretable models is implemented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark knowledge distillation algorithms. This approach successfully improves the prediction accuracy of Soft Decision Tree by a maximum of 8.28%, reaching almost equivalent or even superior performance to deep teacher models. Furthermore, the model-agnostic nature of this approach offers broad application potential.;"[Fan, Yongdong; Li, Qiong; Mao, Haokun] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Feng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Feng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Med & Hlth, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China";"Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology";Li, Q (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.;"hitfyd@hit.edu.cn; qiongli@hit.edu.cn; hkmao@hit.edu.cn; fjiang@hit.edu.cn";"JIANG, Feng/HTP-2862-2023; Fan, Yongdong/HHM-7220-2022";"Fan, Yongdong/0000-0001-6908-1142; Jiang, Feng/0000-0001-8342-1211; Mao, Haokun/0000-0003-2783-821X";National Natural Science Foundation of China;National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));No Statement Available;;32;0;0;2;2;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2168-2194;2168-2208;;IEEE J BIOMED HEALTH;IEEE J.

Traditional ranking systems, such as those provided by QS, ARWU, and THE, have offered valuable insights into university performance by employing a variety of indicators to reflect institutional excellence across research, teaching, international outlook, and more. However, these linear rankings may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of university performance. This study introduces a novel clustering analysis that complements existing rankings by grouping universities with similar characteristics, providing a multidimensional perspective on global higher education landscapes. Utilizing a range of clustering algorithms-K-Means, GMM, Agglomerative, and Fuzzy C-Means-and incorporating both traditional and unique indicators, our approach seeks to highlight the commonalities and shared strengths within clusters of universities. This analysis does not aim to supplant existing ranking systems but to augment them by offering stakeholders an alternative lens through which to view and assess university performance. By focusing on group similarities rather than ordinal positions, our method encourages a more nuanced understanding of institutional excellence and facilitates peer learning among universities with similar profiles. While acknowledging the limitations inherent in any methodological approach, including the selection of indicators and clustering algorithms, this study underscores the value of complementary analyses in enriching our understanding of higher educational institutions' performance.;"[Matlis, George; Dimokas, Nikos] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Informat, Kastoria 52100, Greece; [Karvelis, Petros] Univ Ioannina, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Arta 47100, Greece";University of Ioannina;"Dimokas, N (corresponding author), Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Informat, Kastoria 52100, Greece.;Karvelis, P (corresponding author), Univ Ioannina, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Arta 47100, Greece.";"giorgos_matlis@hotmail.com; ndimokas@uowm.gr; pkarvelis@uoi.gr";;Karvelis, Petros/0000-0002-0483-4868;;;;;30;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2306-5729;;DATA-BASEL;Data;MAY;2024;9;5;;;;;;;67;10.3390/data9050067;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data9050067;;;41;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Multidisciplinary Sciences";Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);"Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics";SC1P0;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001232171200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To be able to develop suitable problem-solving strategies, especially context-based problems, students need to have the ability to formulate situations mathematically well. This research was conducted to observe students' abilities in formulating situations mathematically. The research subjects were students aged 14-16 years in Malang City in February 2023. This research was qualitative research. The data collected was students' answers on context-based mathematical problems from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) whose questions are related to activities of formulating situations mathematically. Result showed that the majority of students did not have sufficient ability and experience in formulating situations mathematically, both in terms of understanding the context of the problem, determining variables, and developing problem-solving strategies. This means that many students still have difficulty determining procedures for solving PISA problems, especially context-based ones. Teachers need to provide more learning and familiarization regarding the process of formulating situations mathematically to make it easier for students to solve context-based mathematical problems.;"[Sa'diyah, Mukhtamilatus; Sa'dijah, Cholis; Susiswo, S.] Univ Negeri Malang, Jl Semarang 5, Malang 65145, Indonesia; [Sa'diyah, Mukhtamilatus] Univ Negeri Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia";"Universitas Negeri Malang; Universitas Negeri Surabaya";Sa'diyah, M (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Malang, Jl Semarang 5, Malang 65145, Indonesia.;cholis.sadijah.fmipa@um.ac.id;;;;;;;32;0;0;0;0;UIKTEN - ASSOC INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & SCIENCE;NOVI PAZAR;HILMA ROZAJCA 15, NOVI PAZAR, 36300, SERBIA;2217-8309;2217-8333;;TEM J;TEM J.;MAY;2024;13;2;;;;;1443;1451;;10.18421/TEM132-58;http://dx.doi.org/10.18421/TEM132-58;;;9;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;SZ7I5;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001238333000058;View Full Record in Web of Science

Teaching games is an increasingly concerned educational strategy, which can improve students' interest and participation in learning through gamification. In order to further optimize the effect of teaching gamification, this paper uses a clustering algorithm to analyse students' learning situation and determine the main factors affecting students' participation, including learning motivation, learning tasks, social interaction and game experience. Based on the results of learning situation analysis, the naive Bayes algorithm is used to analyse students learning behaviour. The model can predict students' future learning needs and interests according to their learning history and behaviour, so as to recommend the most suitable gamified learning resources for them. The design and implementation of this model can help to improve the effect of teaching gamification and provide students with a more personalized learning experience.

This study examined the influence of a case -based AI professional development (PD) program on AI integration strategies and AI literacy among seven middle school science teachers. Employing three distinct case problems, from well -structured to ill -structured, the AI PD program aimed to stimulate teachers' reflection on AI literacy development and encourage the construction of problem -solving and AI integration strategies within various pedagogical contexts. Analysis of video -recorded case discussions revealed that teachers primarily drew on personal experiences for collaborative problem -solving across the three cases. However, the complexity of the case problems influenced their approach to knowledge co -construction, and dealing with ill -structured problems promoted the application of new knowledge. Through analyzing the survey data, we found a marked increase in teachers' AI literacy, particularly in the domain of knowing and understanding AI, suggesting a pivotal role for direct instruction that supports AI literacy growth. However, their application of this AI knowledge was limited during the case discussions, while other domains of teacher AI literacy were more frequently employed. The findings highlight the importance of combining direct instruction with case -based discussions in AI -related PD programs to bolster teacher AI literacy effectively. The research has implications for using a case -based learning approach during short-term PD initiatives and advocates the ongoing need for comprehensive AI literacy development to facilitate teachers' AI integration in subject -specific teaching.;"[Ding, Ai-Chu Elisha; Yang, Haotian] Univ Georgia, Dept Workforce Educ & Instructional Technol, 131 Rivers Crossing 850,Coll Stn Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Choi, Ikseon] Emory Univ, Nell Hodgson Woodruff Sch Nursing, Atlanta, GA USA";"University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Emory University";Ding, ACE (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Workforce Educ & Instructional Technol, 131 Rivers Crossing 850,Coll Stn Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA.;ading@uga.edu;;Ding, Ai-Chu/0000-0001-6783-1181;;;;;60;0;0;29;29;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2666-5573;;;COMPUT EDUC OPEN;Computer Educ.

Deep learning can promote students' understanding of knowledge, conduct in-depth processing of new knowledge, integrate it with the original knowledge, and apply it to new situations, solve intelligent audio-visual listening from the perspective of deep learning, and focus on cultivating students' in-depth learning ability and individual differences in innovative thinking. As the main position of ecological education, schools should effectively strengthen the publicity and education of ecological ideas and low-carbon concepts, and integrate them into education and teaching to effectively improve students' awareness of environmental protection. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of flipped classroom teaching model based on deep learning. Therefore, from the perspective of deep learning, this paper combs the theory of deep learning, constructs a new model of smart classroom, and provides ideas and directions for model reform. In this study, the flipped classroom teaching model based on deep learning was applied to English teaching, and an 8-week teaching experiment was conducted. In addition, this paper believes that it is of great practical significance to carry out environmental protection education with the help of English teaching.;[Li, Yuanyuan] Xuzhou Univ Technol, Coll Foreign Language, Xuzhou 221018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China;Xuzhou University of Technology;Li, YY (corresponding author), Xuzhou Univ Technol, Coll Foreign Language, Xuzhou 221018, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;10379@xzit.edu.cn;;;;;;;25;0;0;7;7;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1875-6891;1875-6883;;INT J COMPUT INT SYS;Int.

The systematic assessment of classroom activity through videos can help understand engagement levels from the perspective of both students and teachers. This practice can also help in robot-assistive classroom monitoring in the context of human-robot interaction. Therefore, we propose a novel algorithm for student-teacher activity recognition using 3D CNN (STAR-3D). The experiment is carried out using India's indigenously developed supercomputer PARAM Shivay by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune, India, under the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM), with a peak performance of 837 TeraFlops. The EduNet dataset (registered under the trademark of the DRSTATM dataset), a self-developed video dataset for classroom activities with 20 action classes, is used to train the model. Due to the unavailability of similar datasets containing both students' and teachers' actions, training, testing, and validation are only carried out on the EduNet dataset with 83.5% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop an end-to-end algorithm that recognises both the students' and teachers' activities in the classroom environment, and it mainly focuses on school levels (K-12). In addition, a comparison with other approaches in the same domain shows our work's novelty. This novel algorithm will also influence the researcher in exploring research on the Convergence of High-Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

Therefore, researchers are paying increasing attention to computational scientific modeling in which students use the computational power of computers to model and learn about science phenomena. However, computational scientific modeling is challenging since it involves not only scientific concepts but also uses computational representations to model the science concepts. This study hypothesizes that prompting students to self -explain critical subgoals of computational scientific modeling before taking part in the construction of models would help them construct correct computational models. This study recruited 65 10th grade students in a 6week program. They were randomly assigned to a self -explanation group (n = 29) where students learned with the self -explanation for subgoals of computational scientific modeling, and a demonstration group (n = 36) where the teacher directly demonstrated the modeling process before students took part in the modeling activity. This study collected the students' performance in a paper -based and hands-on modeling test, and also their modeling actions in the hands-on test to understand the impact of the self -explanation scaffolding on their computational scientific modeling. The results showed that the two groups demonstrated similar levels of improvements in the paper -based test, suggesting that both types of scaffolding are helpful for computational scientific modeling learning. However, the self -explanation group demonstrated significantly better modeling quality in the hands-on test. Furthermore, the spotlight analysis found the moderation effect of the modeling actions on the relation between the two treatments and the model quality. The self -explanation group constructed high quality models if they took only a low number of modeling actions. Conversely, frequent modeling actions are necessary for the demonstration group to construct quality scientific models. The results suggest that the selfexplanation scaffolding is more effective since students did not simply rely on the trial -anderror strategy, but adopted a strategic approach to constructing scientific models.;"[Wen, Cai-Ting] Soochow Univ, Comp Sci & Informat Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liu, Chen-Chung; Chang, Ming-Hua; Chiang, Shih-Hsun Fan] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Jhongli, Taiwan; [Li, Ching-Yuan] New Taipei Municipal HaiSan High Sch, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Hung-Ming] Chang Gung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Cosmet Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Hwang, Fu-Kwun] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Taipei, Taiwan; [Biswas, Gautam] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Nashville, TN USA; [Liu, Chen-Chung] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan, Taiwan";"Soochow University; National Central University; Chang Gung University of Science & Technology; National Taiwan Normal University; Vanderbilt University; National Central University";Liu, CC (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;ccliu@cl.ncu.edu.tw;;;National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan [109-2811-H-008 -005 -MY3];National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan;This research was financially supported partially by the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan under contract numbers 109-2811-H-008 -005 -MY3.;;60;0;0;9;9;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0360-1315;1873-782X;;COMPUT EDUC;Comput.

Despite efforts to showcase its benefits, there remains a gap in understanding whether students embrace programming and intend to persist in learning it. This study investigates the factors influencing the intention of primary school students to learn programming. It explores eight variables like perceived enjoyment, utility, ease of learning, social influence, creative and programming self-efficacy, and collaboration attitude, hypothesized to positively affect students' behavioral intention to learn programming. Demographic factors such as age and gender were also considered. Data from 235 Serbian primary school students were collected via self-report questionnaires. Structural equation modeling revealed that the proposed model significantly explained students' behavioral intention, accounting for 65.9% of the variance. Social influence and perceived enjoyment emerged as the most influential factors.

However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three -level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students' cognitive learning (i. e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education.

Yet the changes of time management behaviors and their associations with learning outcomes are underexplored in online learning of programming. To address the gap, this study employed an intensive longitudinal approach to examine undergraduates' time management behaviors in an online programming problem system. Specifically, we analyzed weekly indicators of academic procrastination and spaced practice derived from programming traces. We applied dynamic structural equation modeling to examine the changes in these behaviors over time and their correlations with weekly quiz performance. Academic procrastination and selfselected spaced practice showed a significant upward trend over time, while incentivized spaced practice exhibited a significant downward trend. Moreover, students with prior programming experience showed a greater growth rate in spacing behaviors. At both within- and between -person levels, procrastination predicted quiz performance significantly and negatively, while self-selected spaced practice predicted quiz performance significantly and positively. In contrast, incentivized spaced practice predicted quiz performance positively at the within -person level but negatively at the between -person level.

Online studies typically attract students in jobs who seek to formalize their competence. Based on qualitative research design, this article sheds light on the academic learning of online students who attend a full-time program. Our focus narrows down to the inaugural class of online students enrolled in a Business and Administration bachelor's program. Specifically, our inquiry delves into the dynamic relationship between the academic progression of these students and their spatial and temporal activities. The article suggests that understanding this polycontextuality by using the metaphor of learning landscapes can help practitioners and students reflect on what influences their academic learning, which can help online students develop selfmanagement skills. Self-management skills are essential in online education, and to help students develop such skills, educators must be aware of the individual learning landscapes of online students when designing online courses. In addition, our findings provide knowledge on how to on-board students in perennial online educational courses.;"[Mathisen, Line; Soreng, Siri Ulfsdatter] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Tromso, Norway";UiT The Arctic University of Tromso;Mathisen, L (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Tromso, Norway.;line.mathisen@uit.no;;;;;;;57;0;0;0;0;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2666-5573;;;COMPUT EDUC OPEN;Computer Educ.

The main layers include perception, decision making, and acting. In the first one, different technologies can be used. The processing of the information provided by the sensors must allow successive modules to understand the environment and Laser imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is one of the most promising ones nowadays for this task. It offers great robustness in detection, but the extraction of information from the point cloud involves the development of complex algorithms that could be very time-consuming if an experimental teaching is intended. This article presents two educational solutions for deepening in perception algorithms using LiDAR for autonomous driving: a closed ad-hoc computer application for two-dimensional (2D) LiDAR point cloud processing and an oriented set of commands for three-dimensional (3D) LiDARs in Matlab. Their use allows main concept exploration in practical sessions with little time consumption and provides students a general overview of the tasks that must be performed by the perception layer in the autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, these tools provide the possibility of organizing different activities in the classroom related to theoretical and experimental issues, and understanding of results because the most tedious tasks are eased.;"[Jimenez, Felipe; Clavijo, Miguel] Tech Univ Madrid, Univ Inst Automobile Res, Madrid 28031, Spain";Universidad Politecnica de Madrid;Jiménez, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Madrid, Univ Inst Automobile Res, Madrid 28031, Spain.;felipe.jimenez@upm.es;Jimenez, Felipe/L-1316-2014;Jimenez, Felipe/0000-0002-9532-3835;Universidad Politecnica de Madrid [IE22.0501];Universidad Politecnica de Madrid;Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Grant/Award Number: IE22.0501;;59;0;0;2;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

The introduction of deep learning algorithms has revolutionised disease detection, but the search for cutting-edge techniques continues to be essential. Enter GIEnsemformerCADx, an innovative hybrid approach poised to revolutionise early colorectal cancer detection. This diagnostic juggernaut offers a comprehensive solution by combining the formidable capabilities of vision transformers, fusion CNNs, and bidirectional LSTM models. Vision transformers derive high-level features from transformed data representations, whereas Fusion CNNs interpret complex spatial correlations within input images. The bidirectional LSTM model complements these advantages by enhancing the understanding of temporal relationships, resulting in an accurate and timely diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The Hyper Kvasir dataset was meticulously calibrated and rebalanced for training purposes, resulting in an optimised training corpus consisting of nine classes extracted from the original 23. The ten-class mixed CKHK-22 dataset was then subjected to rigorous evaluation, confirming the reliability of this method. Using well-known CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, DarkNet-19, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-201, within the CADx system, novel CNN fusion models (ADaDR-22, ADaR-22, and DaRD-22) were created by fusing these pre-trained CNNs. In identifying colorectal cancer, the DaRD-22 model outperformed its competitors, with a remarkable accuracy rate of 93.3% for Hyper Kvasir and 91.67% for the CKHK-22 datasets. GIEnsemformerCADx represents a major advancement in computer-aided colorectal cancer detection. Utilizing hybrid innovation and propelled by the exceptional performance of the DaRD-22 model, it promises to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates through early detection and prompt intervention. In the ever-present battle against colorectal cancer, this innovative system is a beacon of hope and progress.;"[Raju, Akella S. Narasimha; Reddy, G.

In some computer science/engineering departments, Comp-Arch courses are offered without the lab component due to resource constraints and differing pedagogical priorities. This article demonstrates how students working in teams are motivated to study the Comp-Arch course and how instructors can increase student motivation and knowledge by taking advantage of hands-on practices. The teams are asked to design and implement a 16-bit MIPS-like processor with constraints as a specific instruction set, and limited data and instruction memory. Student projects include following three phases, namely, design, desktop simulator implementation, and verification using hardware description language (HDL). In the design phase, teams develop their Comp-Arch to implement specified instructions. A range of designs resulted, e.g., (a) a processor with extensive user-defined instructions resulting in longer cycle times (b) a processor with a minimal instruction set but with a faster clock cycle time. Next, teams developed a desktop simulator in any programming language to execute instructions on the architecture. Finally, students engage in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) projects to simulate and verify the data-path designed during the initial phase. Student feedback and their current understanding of the project were collected through a questionnaire featuring varying Likert scale questions, some with a ten-point scale, and others with a five- point scale. Results of the survey show that the hands-on approach increases students' motivation and knowledge in the Comp-Arch course, which is centered around computer system design principles. This approach can also be effectively extended to related courses, such as Microprocessor Design, which delves into the intricacies of creating and implementing microprocessors or central processing units (CPUs) at the hardware level. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates that interactions, specifically through peer reviews and public presentations, between students in each phase increases their knowledge and perspective on designing custom processors.;"[Dogan, Mustafa] ASELSAN Res, Ankara, Turkiye; [Dogan, Mustafa] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Ankara, Turkiye; [Oztoprak, Kasim] Konya Food & Agr Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Konya, Turkiye; [Tolun, Mehmet Resit] Cankaya Univ, Dept Software Engn, Ankara, Turkiye";"Hacettepe University; Konya Food & Agriculture University; Cankaya University";"Dogan, M (corresponding author), ASELSAN Res, Ankara, Turkiye.;Dogan, M (corresponding author), Hacettepe Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Ankara, Turkiye.";mustafadogan@aselsan.com.tr;Oztoprak, Kasim/U-1631-2018;"Oztoprak, Kasim/0000-0003-2483-8070; Dogan, Mustafa/0009-0005-2591-783X";;;;;55;0;0;6;6;PEERJ INC;LONDON;341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND;;2376-5992;;PEERJ COMPUT SCI;PeerJ Comput.

ASD is a developmental disorder caused by neurological problems. In schools and educational environments, this disorder may not only hinder a child's learning, but also lead to more crises and mental convulsions. In order to teach students with ASD, it is essential to understand the impact of their learning environment on their interaction and behavior. Different methods have been used to diagnose ASD in the past, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Research into ASD diagnostics has largely focused on machine learning algorithms and strategies rather than diagnostic methods. This article discusses many diagnostic techniques used in the ASD literature, such as neuroimaging, speech recordings, facial features, and EEG signals. This has led us to conclude that in schools and educational settings, autism can be diagnosed cheaply, quickly, and accurately through face analysis. To facilitate and speed up the processing of facial information among children in educational settings, we applied the AlexNet architecture designed for edge computing. A fast method for detecting autism spectrum disorders from the face can be applied to educational settings using this structure. While we have investigated a variety of methods, the face can provide us with appropriate information about the disorder. In addition, it can produce more interpretive features. In order to help students in schools who are suffering from this disease, key factors must be considered: potential clinical and therapeutic situations, efficiency, predictability, privacy protection, accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and lack of methodological intervention.

It actively engages students, increases motivation by giving a sense of ownership of the assessment process, encourages autonomy and critical analysis skills, broadens their understanding of the topic, enhances problem-solving and self-assessment abilities as well as develops soft skills. Peer assessment is also beneficial to the teachers as it reduces the strain of the repetitive grading process thus opening more resources for teaching and the development of course materials, especially in large courses with hundreds of students. Sometimes, peer assessment is the only viable option, as in MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). Peer assessment has long been studied at all education levels and is gaining traction in recent years, where MOOCs and even the Covid pandemic, which instigated the development of digital competencies, had a positive influence. However, peer assessment is still a demanding process to carry out, but one that can be assisted by modern Internet technology. This paper has a twofold contribution: we present the peer assessment module of our open-source automated programming assessment system Edgar which has been heavily used and developed for the last six years, while peer assessment has been used for the previous three years. Additionally, we present a methodology used and a two-year case study of peer assessment of open-ended assignments in the undergraduate Databases course where 500+ students per season had to provide an entityrelationship model for a given domain and assess their peers' submissions. We discuss our grading methodology, provide in-depth data analysis, and present the students' opinions of the process acquired through an anonymous questionnaire.

Recently, several approaches using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) view knowledge tracing problems as predicting a student's future performance based on the student's past learning activities. However, deep learning -based models merely predict the students' future performance, failing to explain the reason why the students answered correctly or incorrectly. These approaches are seldom investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deep understanding of student learning. In this paper, we first define incremental knowledge tracing problem and then propose a dynamic tracing method to track students' knowledge changes, a new online learning -based model, named Online Meta -knowledge Dictionary Learning (OMDL). OMDL assumes that student knowledge increment is processed with stationary independent increments and derives the objective function of knowledge tracing from the perspective of probability. More precisely, this method has three innovations: propose an online learning algorithm suitable for hidden Markov data; update the metaknowledge dictionary and students' knowledge representation online without collecting all data; and trace student knowledge increment explicitly. The empirical study was conducted on four education public datasets, with student prediction accuracy used as the metric for assessing algorithm effectiveness.

Effective remote teaching relies on the high interactivity of interaction platforms and the precise delivery of teaching content, with multimodal image recognition technology playing a key role. This technology enhances the intelligence level of remote teaching platforms by integrating visual and textual information, providing a richer and more intuitive interactive experience for teachers and students. However, existing multimodal image recognition technologies still face challenges in accuracy, real-time performance, and semantic understanding, especially in complex teaching scenarios where the understanding and feedback on teaching content are not accurate enough, limiting the effectiveness of remote teaching interaction platforms. Addressing these limitations, this paper proposes a multimodal image alignment method based on a self-attention mechanism that effectively integrates visual information into an encoder-decoder model to achieve high consistency between images and teaching content. Additionally, a novel multimodal image annotation and recognition algorithm is introduced, considering both semantic information and visual saliency to achieve higher recognition accuracy and practicality. Experimental validation shows significant improvements in the accuracy and real-time performance of multimodal image recognition, providing strong technical support for remote teaching interaction platforms, optimizing the allocation of teaching resources, and enhancing the quality and efficiency of education.;"[Fang, Qin; Zhang, Yawen] Xinjiang Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China";Xinjiang Normal University;Zhang, YW (corresponding author), Xinjiang Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China.;xjsdzyw@xjnu.edu.cn;;;The 2022 Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project Research on the Cultivation System of Digital Literacy for Farmers in Southern Xinjiang under the Background of Rural Revitalization [22BJYX076];The 2022 Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project Research on the Cultivation System of Digital Literacy for Farmers in Southern Xinjiang under the Background of Rural Revitalization;The 2022 Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Philosophy and Social Science Fund Project Research on the Cultivation System of Digital Literacy for Farmers in Southern Xinjiang under the Background of Rural Revitalization (Grant No.: 22BJYX076) .;;20;0;0;3;3;INT INFORMATION & ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY ASSOC;EDMONTON;#2020, SCOTIA PLACE TOWER ONE, 10060 JASPER AVE, EDMONTON, AB T5J 3R8, CANADA;0765-0019;1958-5608;;TRAIT SIGNAL;Trait.

First, based on face recognition technology, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep features, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) texture features, and ScaleInvariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features of images are extracted and fused, because three feature extraction algorithms have different feature extraction capabilities and have certain robustness to changes in image lighting, rotation, scale, and other factors, fusion can make feature vectors more comprehensive and rich in information, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of detection and recognition; second, a ResNet network is constructed to complete the basic classification of learning expressions and verify the experimental results; In order to enhance the ability of deep learning methods to learn discriminative features from noisy signals and further improve classification accuracy, then, by combining the channel attention mechanism and soft thresholding to improve the ResNet network, a Deep Residual Shrinkage Network (DRSN) is constructed to achieve emotion recognition of college students' online learning; finally, through a horizontal comparison experiment of multiple different network structures, the effectiveness of the soft threshold attention mechanism is verified. This method obtains more complete facial expression features for emotion classification through feature fusion, and combines the channel attention mechanism module. The recognition accuracy of DRSN network is 84.12%, which is about 4.17% higher than the original ResNet network (79.95%). The application of this research can assess the concentration of college students in online learning and measure the degree of emotional engagement of college students.

This research explores vocal music teaching against the backdrop of the twenty-first century educational reforms seeking innovation and pursuing new teaching methodologies. The goal is to develop an autonomous learning framework reinforced by machine learning techniques that use conventional neural networks. The present study aims to implement machine learning algorithms in education, because esthetic education promotes excellence and humanistic attributes in educational environments, and art is essential in social activities. The main goal is to provide a framework that enables music education majors to access a customizable learning environment by integrating a pluralistic network approach and the strength of conventional neural networks. Music education constitutes an integral facet of quality, ideological, and moral education within general colleges and universities. The mission of music education, cultivating competent teachers for various Chinese institutions, necessitates a comprehensive understanding of students' learning patterns, thinking characteristics, and behavioral phenomena. This study analyzes these facets across diverse levels and perspectives, employing empirical generalization, literature synthesis, logical reasoning, and action research methodologies. The research findings underscore an accuracy rate of 97.4%, emphasizing the augmentation of students' independent learning abilities in vocal music education at higher education institutions.

In ACS problems, one desires the best sequence of learning materials that meet the profile of a given student. To do so, multiple features of the students and the materials used are necessary to generate good solutions. In fact, understanding the students' goals, motivation, and preferences is not an easy task and, consequently, different Internet of Things (IoT) approaches to gather this information during the learning process have been proposed. Actually, some works from the literature consider five objectives and, in this case, one has a many-objective optimization problem. Instead of solving the optimization problem considering the multiple objectives individually, the usual approach is to obtain solutions for a weighted sum of the objective values using search approaches for mono -objective optimization problems. However, this kind of approach may bias the search and limits the capacity of finding good results. Here, we solve the multi -objective ACS problem considering five objective functions. NSGA-II, a wellknown Genetic Algorithm for multi -objective optimization problems, was used. In addition, the aggregation trees were employed to reduce the number of objectives to two and three due to the large number of objectives in the original problem. ACS problems from the literature were used to comparatively evaluate the proposed methods and the results obtained were compared to those found by the traditional approach of summing the objective values.

It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socioethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.;"[Stolpe, Karin; Hallstrom, Jonas] Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning IBL, Linkoping, Sweden";Linkoping University;Stolpe, K (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Behav Sci & Learning IBL, Linkoping, Sweden.;karin.stolpe@liu.se;;"Stolpe, Karin/0000-0002-6859-1420; Hallstrom, Jonas/0000-0003-0829-3349";;;;;56;5;5;104;106;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2666-5573;;;COMPUT EDUC OPEN;Computer Educ.

In the engineering field, the adoption of BL allows creating challenging situations for students with industry-like problems to foster the acquisition of advanced problem-solving skills. Thus, it can be used to enhance traditional learning by enriching it with new aspects, allowing to update the Intended Learning Outcomes traditionally defined by teachers. Although prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) teachers had the time to prepare and programme the transition to BL, during the pandemic they had to abruptly move to the full digital delivery of the content, requiring technological and organizational adaptation, as well as change in the content teaching and assessment methods. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to understand how BL has been implemented in the engineering field by HEIs, discussing if and how the learning expectations of teachers (evaluated through Bloom's Taxonomy) change when using different mixes of face-to-face and digital activities and when the target audience changes. More specifically, the investigation addresses how content and learning expectations are split and set in face-to-face and digital settings. Additionally, the interest is towards understanding how COVID-19 impacted the adoption of BL, not only during the pandemic but also after.;"[Sala, Roberto; Pirola, Fabiana; Pezzotta, Giuditta] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Dalmine, Italy; [Maffei, Antonio; Enoksson, Fredrik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, Sweden; [Ljubic, Sandi; Skoki, Arian] Univ Rijeka, Fac Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Rijeka, Croatia; [Zammit, Joseph P.; Bonello, Amberlynn] Univ Malta, Dept Ind & Mfg Engn, CERU, Msida, Malta; [Podrzaj, Primoz; Zuzek, Tena] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Mech Engn, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Priarone, Paolo C.; Antonelli, Dario] Dept Management & Prod Engn, Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy; [Sala, Roberto] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy";"University of Bergamo; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Rijeka; University of Malta; University of Ljubljana; Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Bergamo";Sala, R (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Viale Marconi 5, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy.;"roberto.sala@unibg.it; maffei@kth.se; fabiana.pirola@unibg.it; fen@kth.se; sandi.ljubic@riteh.uniri.hr; arian.skoki160@gmail.com; joseph.zammit@um.edu.mt; amberlynn.bonello@um.edu.mt; primoz.podrzaj@fs.uni-lj.si; tena.zuzek@fs.uni-lj.si; paoloclaudio.priarone@polito.it; dario.antonelli@polito.it; giuditta.pezzotta@unibg.it";"Skoki, Arian/AAO-7336-2021; Zammit, Joseph/KYP-8285-2024; Pezzotta, Giuditta/AAF-2297-2021; Sala, Roberto/D-8617-2017";"Skoki, Arian/0000-0002-7164-1994; Zammit, Joseph/0000-0002-9271-9682; Pezzotta, Giuditta/0000-0001-7983-8356; Ljubic, Sandi/0000-0003-3456-8369; Bonello, Amberlynn/0009-0006-8950-5268; /0000-0002-0723-1712; Sala, Roberto/0000-0001-7671-6927";"European Commission [2021-1-SE01-KA220-HED-000023166]; European Commission through the BLISS Project, GA; Erasmus+ Programme";"European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commission through the BLISS Project, GA; Erasmus+ Programme(Erasmus+)";This work was co-funded by the European Commission through the BLISS Project, GA 2021-1-SE01-KA220-HED-000023166, under the Erasmus+ Programme.;;120;0;0;13;19;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1061-3773;1099-0542;;COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC;Comput.

These intelligent machines can interact with students in classrooms and learning environments, providing personalized educational support. To enable education robots to fulfill their roles, they require accurate object detection capabilities to perceive and understand the surrounding environment of students, identify targets, and interact with them. Object detection in complex environments remains challenging, as classrooms or learning scenarios involve various objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of object detection is crucial for the development of education robots. This paper introduces the progress of an education robot's object detection based on a brain-inspired heuristic method, which integrates Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, and semi-supervised learning. By combining the strengths of these three techniques, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of object detection in education robot systems. In this work, we integrate two popular object detection algorithms: Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3. We conduct a series of experiments on the task of education robot object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed optimization algorithm significantly outperforms individual algorithms in terms of accuracy and real-time performance. Moreover, through semi-supervised learning, we achieve better performance with fewer labeled samples. This will provide education robots with more accurate perception capabilities, enabling better interaction with students and delivering personalized educational experiences. It will drive the development of the field of education robots, offering innovative and personalized solutions for education.;"[Hong, Qing] Nanjing Vocat Univ Ind Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Dong, Hao] Shandong Vocat Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Econ Management, Weifang, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Deng, Wei] Hunan Biol & Electromech Polytech, Inst Informat Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ping, Yihan] Northwestern Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Evanston, IL USA";"Nanjing Vocational University of Industry Technology; Northwestern University";"Dong, H (corresponding author), Shandong Vocat Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Econ Management, Weifang, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Deng, W (corresponding author), Hunan Biol & Electromech Polytech, Inst Informat Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.";"donghao@stu.cpu.edu.cn; hnbemc_dw@163.com";;;The 2023 Higher Vocational Education Aesthetic Education Teaching Research [2023MB013];The 2023 Higher Vocational Education Aesthetic Education Teaching Research;The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The machine learning regression (MLR) algorithm has brought a new breakthrough to SSM remote sensing estimation due to its powerful nonlinear fitting ability. However, the high-precision estimation of temporal SSM still faces challenges. In this study, we evaluated the temporal robustness and transfer performance of six MLR algorithms for SSM estimation and conducted a universality experiment in agricultural areas with abundant land cover types. First, the factors affecting the estimation accuracy of SSM were analyzed from the perspectives of dynamic variables (backscattering, multi-spectrum, and brightness temperature [TB]) and steady variables (soil texture [ST] and soil roughness [SR]). Results showed that radar incidence angle (RIA) is the key factor for estimating SSM accurately from dual polarization backscattering (dual-pol sigma) data. The introduction of multi-spectrum data can considerably improve the estimation accuracy of SSM and is better than that of TB data. The physical measures (ST) or geometric measures (SR) can be used as auxiliary features for multi-spectrum or TB data, which improve the accuracy of SSM estimated from dual-pol sigma data, with similar improvement effects. Multi-source data can effectively reduce the adverse effects of surface heterogeneity on SSM estimation. Ensemble learning and kernel learning algorithms have similar performance in the case of low-dimensional features and small samples. However, the neural network algorithms can correctly reflect the temporal variation of SSM only in the case of multi-dimensional features and large samples. The optimal accuracy of multi-temporal SSM is estimated by the Gaussian process regression algorithm (RMSE = 0.028 cm(3)/cm(3)). Moreover, to address poor transfer performance of temporal SSM in MLR models (RMSE > 0.060 cm(3)/cm(3)), this study proposed three strategies including the constraint of target domain samples, scattering model, and clustering model. The optimal error (RMSE) of multi-temporal SSM estimated by the three strategies is 0.032, 0.045, and 0.045 cm(3)/cm(3). Overall, the strategies proposed can mitigate the issue of overestimation or underestimation resulting from the inconsistent distribution of SSM and RIAs at various phases. The soil parameters, acting as the medium across different phases, can notably enhance the temporal transfer performance of SSM regression models. This study introduces a novel framework for achieving high estimation accuracy and transfer performance of temporal SSM at a regional scale.;"[Jiaxin, Qian; Jie, Yang; Weidong, Sun; Lei, Shi; Chaoya, Dang] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Lingli, Zhao] Wuhan Univ Technol, Coll Remote Sensing Informat Engn, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China";"Wuhan University; Wuhan University of Technology";Weidong, S (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;widensun2012@whu.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071295, 61971318, U2033216, U22A2010]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2022CFB193]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province)";Acknowledgement This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 42071295, No. 61971318, No. U2033216, No. U22A2010, and the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province under Grant No. 2022CFB193.

The study presents a concept for constructing a research framework in the realm of computer ethics impact. This involves the introduction of an information fusion model and the utilization of a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory algorithm. The information fusion model aims to integrate multiple sources of evidence related to computer ethics, including expert opinions, public attitudes, and legal regulations. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the platform's impact perception was effective in reducing the number of individuals who consider computer ethics unnecessary from 40% to 3%. This finding highlights the potential of this platform for enhancing public awareness and understanding of computer ethics. In conclusion, the proposed information fusion model and D-S evidence theory algorithm offer a valuable tool for conducting early research on the construction of computer ethics.

The application of machine learning techniques is playing an important role in this era. Thyroid is one of the chronic endocrine diseases, and approximately 42 million people in India are affected by this disease. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the enhancement of classification performance through the novel 'FeatureBoostThyro' (FBT) model. The study evaluates various machine learning algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), K nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), naive bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM), in conjunction with diverse feature selection methods. The research systematically explores the impact of feature selection techniques such as information gain, relief F, chi-square, gini index, forward selection, backward selection, recursive feature elimination, and LASSO on model performance across the chosen algorithms. The analysis reveals notable variations in performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing valuable insights into the interplay between algorithm and feature selection. One main contribution of this research is the introduction of the FBT model, which consistently outperforms other models across various feature selection methods, making it a promising tool for addressing complex classification tasks.

The methodology systematically categorises writing quality and can increase operational effectiveness in academic and major commercial institutions. To study the projected score, AES relies on extracting numerous aspects from the student's response, including grammatical and textural information. However, the recovered features may result in dimensionality reduction and a challenging-to-understand feature selection procedure. As the number of parameters rises, the model also demands a large cost for processing and training the data. However, these problems worsen the accuracy of score prediction and widen the gap between actual and anticipated results. This study suggested the Fox-optimised Long Short-Term Memory-based Augmented Language Model (FLSTM-ALM) as a solution to these problems for giving successful training to text features; the model uses an augmented learning paradigm. The retrieval score was then analysed and generated using a neural knowledge encoder and retriever. The neural model successfully classifies the output based on this score. The best features are chosen using the Fox optimisation algorithm based on the food-searching category. This choice of parameters solves the exploration and optimisation issues with document classification. The performance of the optimised AES system was assessed using the two datasets, ASAP and ETS, and it demonstrated a high accuracy of 98.92% and a low error rate of 0.096%. Dimensionality reduction can thus be fixed by optimising the FLSTM-ALM model with an appropriate meta-heuristic method, such as the FOX algorithm, which raises the predicted accuracy, recall, and f1 score for the AES model.";"[Chassab, Ridha Hussein; Zakaria, Lailatul Qadri; Tiun, Sabrina] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Chassab, Ridha Hussein] Iraqi Def Univ Mil Studies, Staff Coll, Training Dept, Baghdad 10001, Iraq";Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Zakaria, LQ (corresponding author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.;lailatul.qadri@ukm.edu.my;;tiun, sabrina/0000-0002-1134-973X;Fakulti Teknologi dan Sains Maklumat, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Fakulti Teknologi dan Sains Maklumat, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;No Statement Available;;26;1;1;3;3;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2024;12;;;;;;48713;48724;;10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3381619;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3381619;;;12;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";NA6E7;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001197749100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university.

In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors.

Participants actively participated in a remote learning challenge by attending synchronous online classes, while their EEG data was captured. The work seeks to comprehend synchronization and intermittent desynchronization through state-of-the-art neuroimaging and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. By analyzing data obtained from EEG, it is feasible to evaluate the level of brainwave synchronization between teachers and students using correlation coefficients. For educators, the study's findings provide valuable insights that can be used to improve instructional techniques and guide them through the ever-changing digital ecosystem. Understanding ideal synchronization times and the factors contributing to desynchronization makes it possible to design therapies that enhance cognitive resonance.

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students' individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K-12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers.

These challenges radically impacted the research fields that gravitate around data management and processing, with the introduction of distributed data-intensive systems that offer innovative programming models and implementation strategies to handle data characteristics such as its volume, the rate at which it is produced, its heterogeneity, and its distribution. Each data-intensive system brings its specific choices in terms of data model, usage assumptions, synchronization, processing strategy, deployment, guarantees in terms of consistency, fault tolerance, and ordering. Yet, the problems data-intensive systems face and the solutions they propose are frequently overlapping. This article proposes a unifying model that dissects the core functionalities of data-intensive systems, and discusses alternative design and implementation strategies, pointing out their assumptions and implications.

Until recently, most validation methods have relied on batch calculation and have required considerable human expertise in their interpretation. Improving real-time performance and interpretability of cluster validation, therefore, continues to be an important theme in unsupervised learning. Building upon previous work on incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs), this paper introduces the Meta- iCVI as a tool for explainable and concise labeling of partition quality in online clustering. Leveraging a time-series classifier and data-fusion techniques, the Meta- iCVI combines the outputs of multiple iCVIs to produce a streaming label of either over, under, or correctly partitioned. Experiments were conducted on generalized synthetic and real-world data sets to demonstrate the efficacy and application of this method. Results of 100% accuracy were achieved in labeling partition quality on real-world data sets including MNIST and FLIR ADAS, demonstrating that the Meta- iCVI is a powerful and efficient tool for classifying partition quality in a variety of conditions. Its introduction should empower new and more efficient streaming clustering techniques. Additionally, we believe this to be the first implementation of an ensemble iCVI metric and the first time iCVI validation performance has been evaluated on randomized sample presentation.;"[Melton, Niklas M.; Petrenko, Sasha A.; Wunsch II, Donald C.] Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA";"University of Missouri System; Missouri University of Science & Technology";Melton, NM (corresponding author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.;nmmz76@umsystem.edu;;Petrenko, Sasha/0000-0003-2442-8901;Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) Mary K.

By analyzing the distinctive features of HTTP/2 protocol, the study suggests extending DDoS attack detection techniques established for HTTP/1 to the realm of HTTP/2. Furthermore, the research underscores the ease with which adversaries can exploit the intrinsic multiplexing in HTTP/2 to launch a large number of malicious requests, leading to severe depletion of network bandwidth and exhaustion of valuable server resources. Additionally, it highlights the potential applicability of deep learning algorithms in the context of the HTTP/2 protocol. Additionally, the article proposes strategies to address challenges associated with DDoS attacks and the scarcity of adequate datasets for HTTP/2. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the security implications surrounding the HTTP/2 protocol and provides valuable insights for advancing DDoS attack detection technologies.;"[Ming, Liang] Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Off Informat Technol, Chongqing 402160, Peoples R China; [Ming, Liang; Leau, Yu-Beng] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Comp & Informat, Cybersecur Res Lab, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Malaysia; [Xie, Ying] Yangtze Normal Univ, Expt Primary Sch 1, Chongqing 400030, Peoples R China";"Chongqing University of Arts & Sciences; Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Yangtze Normal University";Leau, YB (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Comp & Informat, Cybersecur Res Lab, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Malaysia.;lybeng@ums.edu.my;;Leau, Yu Beng/0000-0002-5386-2734;National Natural Science Foundation of China;National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC));No Statement Available;;29;0;0;3;3;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2024;12;;;;;;33296;33308;;10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371013;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";KE3Q6;;gold;;;2024-08-19;WOS:001178246800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Such a shift poses several challenges for students at Higher Education Institutes. This paper presents a taxonomy of such challenges faced by first-year mathematics students in the Pacific region during the ERT dictated by the COVID-19 pandemic. First, a list of 44 challenges was assembled based on a university's in-house monitoring report, literature review and the authors' experiences of challenges faced by students. Next, the open card sorting technique involving 32 participants was used to classify these challenges. Open card sorting is a well-established method for discovering how people understand and categorize information. This paper employed a recently proposed algorithm to quantitatively analyze open card sorting data using the Best Merge Method, Category Validity Technique and Multidimensional Scaling. Analysis of the collected card sort data produced the initial taxonomy of challenges. Finally, the participants were asked to answer a questionnaire so that we could validate and further refine the taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy includes seven challenges: i) lack of online learning support; ii) problem with online course delivery; iii) time and workload management; iv) learning management system issues; v) lack of face-to-face interaction; vi) financial hardship; vii) internet challenge.

While the creation, financing, and positive and negative outcomes of a start-up have all been widely researched, more research is needed to understand the entrepreneurial environment that supports, nurtures, and educates entrepreneurs. Higher education institutions are one such element of this ecosystem that is essential in educating India's future business people. Therefore, this study is intended to establish the practice of entrepreneurship learning in higher educational institutions in India and to analyze the perception of students on entrepreneurship education. Using proportional stratified random selection, 345 undergraduate students from India's top-ranked universities made up the overall sample for this. SEM analysis was used to assess the study's hypotheses, and the link between the variables was investigated using SEM analysis. The results showed thatgovernment regulation, socioeconomic circumstances, entrepreneurial orientation, monetary assistance, and entrepreneurial confidence favorably impact entrepreneurial motivation.

However, its use is still far from widespread in education. One of the reasons mentioned in the literature is the lack of AR authoring tools that consider the educational perspective, which means they do not usually take pedagogic aspects into account. This work investigates what characteristics are important for AR authoring in education in the form of design principles. We aimed to identify how teachers would like to create AR experiences based on their pedagogic needs through design-based research (DBR) with the participation of an interdisciplinary team to investigate and propose design principles for AR educational authoring. We followed the four steps of DBR in two cycles. We worked with multiple teachers, mostly English teachers, to understand their educational needs when authoring AR experiences. Based on that, we defined and prototyped an application focused on language learning for children and teenagers, which we evaluated in two test rounds. As a result, we proposed 11 design principles divided into three aspects: infrastructure, AR, and pedagogy. These principles were evaluated positively by teachers. To help us understand the options currently available for teachers, we analyzed the existing AR authoring tools that do not require programming to see if they meet the proposed design principles. Most of them lack important features for teachers, specifically pedagogical ones. Finally, we provided an in-depth discussion of the context and application of those principles.;"[Silva, Manoela; Roberto, Rafael; Teichrieb, Veronica] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Informat, Voxar Labs, BR-50740560 Recife, Brazil; [Radu, Iulian; Schneider, Bertrand] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cavalcante, Patricia] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Educ, EDUMATEC, BR-50670901 Recife, Brazil";"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Harvard University; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco";Silva, M (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Informat, Voxar Labs, BR-50740560 Recife, Brazil.;"mmos@cin.ufpe.br; rar3@cin.ufpe.br; iulian_radu@g.harvard.edu; patricia3smith@gmail.com; bertrand_schneider@g.harvard.edu; vt@cin.ufpe.br";Teichrieb, Veronica/J-6466-2012;"Roberto, Rafael/0000-0002-9549-7376; Teichrieb, Veronica/0000-0003-4685-3634; Oliveira da Silva, Manoela Milena/0000-0001-5401-6540; Cavalcante, Patricia/0000-0003-3570-684X";"Funda#x00E7;#x00E3;o de Amparo a Ci#x00EA;ncia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco";"Funda#x00E7;#x00E3;o de Amparo a Ci#x00EA;ncia e Tecnologia de Pernambuco";No Statement Available;;64;0;0;12;13;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

Because of a large number of algorithms and complex theoretical constructions, these topics represent a difficult and complex domain for teachers to teach and for students to gain a better understanding. Educational software systems play an increasingly important role in the engineering sciences. These systems aim to help students learn by turning abstract theoretical concepts into tangible objects that students can interact with. In this article, we present the web-based simulation system ComVis, which represents a set of tools for learning and teaching topics in the field of compilers. The original version of the ComVis system is written in Java and is available as a desktop application. For greater accessibility and better visual representation, we have developed a web-based simulation system. In addition to new functionalities, this system also includes a large number of topics from the field of compilers. This article provides an overview of the tools that comprise the web-based ComVis system, with an emphasis on the interactivity that students achieve with the system in the learning process. The results of using the web-based ComVis system were verified by a quantitative evaluation of the system's effectiveness through a controlled experiment and a qualitative evaluation of usability by student survey and heuristic tests by experts.;"[Stamenkovic, Srecko] Topl Acad Appl Studies, Dept Business Studies Blace, Prokuplje 18400, Serbia; [Jovanovic, Nenad] Univ Pristina Kosovska Mitrovica, Fac Tech Sci, Kosovska Mitrovica 38220, Serbia";Universiteti i Prishtines;Stamenkovic, S (corresponding author), Topl Acad Appl Studies, Dept Business Studies Blace, Prokuplje 18400, Serbia.;"stamenkovic.srecko@gmail.com; nenad.jovanovic@pr.ac.rs";Stamenković, Srećko/ADC-7990-2022;"Stamenković, Srećko/0000-0002-0933-4379; Jovanovic, Nenad/0000-0002-8872-7516";;;;;67;1;1;3;3;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1939-1382;;;IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL;IEEE Trans.

The study compares the effectiveness of a traditional library program with a Metaversebased library program in terms of knowledge acquisition and library anxiety. The research also examines students' perceptions of implementing gamification within the context of the Gamified Metaverse platform. A mixed -methods approach was adopted, including pre- and post-test analysis, statistical analysis, and qualitative data collection. The results indicate that both the traditional and Metaverse-based library programs effectively increased the participants' knowledge, with no significant difference between the two approaches. However, the Metaverse-based program was found to be less effective in facilitating interaction with librarians and reducing library anxiety. Additionally, students expressed positive perceptions of implementing gamification in the Gamified Metaverse platform, finding it engaging and motivating. These findings contribute to the understanding of the effect of the Metaverse as a tool for promoting library services and enhancing knowledge acquisition. However, it is not as effective in reducing library anxiety, particularly in terms of interaction with librarians and staff. It should be noted that the platform may have limitations such as high costs and potential side effects of virtual reality, making it more suitable as an additional tool for promoting library services, taking into account its feasibility and potential benefits for specific student populations and larger libraries.;"[Sureephong, Pradorn; Chernbumroong, Suepphong; Niemsup, Supicha; Homla, Pipitton; Intawong, Kannikar; Puritat, Kitti] Chiang Mai Univ, Chiang Mai, Thailand";Chiang Mai University;Puritat, K (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Chiang Mai, Thailand.;"pradorn.s@cmu.ac.th; suepphong.c@cmu.ac.th; supicha_n@cmu.ac.th; pipitton_h@cmu.ac.th; kannikar.i@cmu.ac.th; kitti.p@cmu.ac.th";;;;;;;47;0;0;15;15;AMER LIBRARY ASSOC;CHICAGO;50 E HURON ST, CHICAGO, IL 60611 USA;0730-9295;2163-5226;;INFORM TECHNOL LIBR;Inf.

Information technology has also had a significant impact on the growth of the education sector, resulting in a fast-paced and resource-rich setting for student interaction. Through the network platform, various interactive software can improve students' learning methods, especially language teaching software. English audio-visual speaking is software for training English language listening and speaking, which can carry out relevant oral activities and topic discussions according to the imported materials. As a result, you can assist pupils in using the vocabulary and knowledge associated with the subject, which will increase their interest in learning. English teachers can fully prepare for speaking and listening tasks in the classroom by using audio-visual speaking. At the same time, through the learning of TV and movie trailers, English audio-visual speaking can provide readers with background knowledge, which is ready for readers to fully understand the language and content in the video materials. Based on information technology, this paper constructs English audio-visual and oral mobile teaching software, which depends on interactive digital media algorithms. Through the mobile teaching software for English audio-visual speaking, students can form good English listening and reading habits, which will provide important help for English language learning.First, this essay examines the value and benefits of mobile applications for providing English instruction orally and visually, which might help to illustrate the need for software development.
